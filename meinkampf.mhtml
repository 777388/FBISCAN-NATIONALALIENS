PREFACE=20


On April 1, 1924,1 entered upon my prison term in the fortress=20
of Landsberg am Lech, as sentenced by the People=E2=80=99s Court in=20
Munich on that day.=20

Thus, after years of uninterrupted work, an opportunity was=20
for the first time offered me to embark upon a task which many=20
had demanded and which I myself felt to be worth while for the=20
movement. I decided to set forth, in two volumes, the aims of=20
our movement, and also to draw a picture of its development.=20
From this it will be possible to learn more than from any purely=20
doctrinaire treatise.=20

At the same time I have had occasion to give an account of my=20
own development, in so far as this is necessary for the under=C2=AC=20
standing of the first as well as the second volume, and in so far=20
as it may serve to destroy the foul legends about my person dished=20
up in the Jewish press.=20

I do not address this work to strangers, but to those adherents=20
of the movement who belong to it with their hearts, and whose=20
intelligence is eager for a more penetrating enlightenment. I=20
know that men are won over less by the written than by the=20
spoken word, that every great movement on this earth owes its=20
growth to great orators and not to great writers.=20

Nevertheless, for a doctrine to be disseminated uniformly and=20
coherently, its basic elements must be set down for all time. To=20
this end I wish to contribute these two volumes as foundation=20
stones in our common edifice.=20

Translator's Note=20


MEIN KAMPF is written in the style of a self-educated mod=C2=AC=20
ern South German with a gift for oratory. Of course this picture=20
does not begin to characterize Hitler the man, but it does, I think,=20
account for the elements of his style.=20

Beginning in his Vienna period, Hitler was a voracious news=C2=AC=20
paper reader. The style of the Austrian press, as Karl Kraus=20
never wearied of pointing out, was slovenly, illogical, pretentious.=20
Even the grammar, doubtless because of the large number of=20
Czechs, Hungarians, and other foreigners in the trade, was un=C2=AC=20
commonly bad. Hitler inveighed against the Viennese melting=20
pot, but was unconsciously influenced by its literary style.=20

He must also have read popular pamphlets on history, psy=C2=AC=20
chology, racist biology, and political subjects. He never at=C2=AC=20
tempted to systematize his knowledge; he retained, for the most=20
part, disjointed facts that met some personal need, and phrases=20
that appealed to his oratorical sense. But the main source of=20
his pet phrases was the theater and the opera. He is full of popu=C2=AC=20
lar quotations from Goethe and Schiller, and largely unintelligible=20
flights of Wagnerian terminology. There is no indication that he=20
ever read any of the German, let alone foreign classics, from=20
which he might have gathered some feeling for stylistic prin=C2=AC=20
ciples.=20

Hitler has been called a paranoiac; at all events, his view of=20
the world is highly personal. Even where he is discussing theo=C2=AC=20
retical matters like =E2=80=98the state/ =E2=80=98race/ etc., he seldom pur=
sues any=20
logic inherent in the subject matter. He makes the most extraor=C2=AC=20
dinary allegations without so much as an attempt to prove them.=20
Often there is no visible connection between one paragraph and=20


Xll=20


Translator=E2=80=99s Note=20


the next. The logic is purely psychological: Hitler is fighting his=20
persecutors, magnifying his person, creating a dream-world in=20
which he can be an important figure. In more concrete passages=20
he is combating political adversaries in his own movement, but=20
even here the continuity is mystifying, because he never tells us=20
whom he is arguing against, but sets up every political expedient=20
as a universal principle.=20

This personalism makes Hitler a poor observer. His style is=20
without color and movement. Images are rare, and when they=20
do appear, they tend to be purely verbal and impossible to=20
visualize, like the =E2=80=98cornerstone for the end of German domina=C2=AC=
=20
tion in the monarchy/ or forcing =E2=80=98the less strong and less healthy=
=20
back into the womb of the eternal unknown.=E2=80=99 The mixed meta=C2=AC=20
phor is almost a specialty of modern German journalism, but=20
Hitler, with his eyes closed to the visual world, was an expert in=20
his own right. Pohner, for example, was =E2=80=98a thorn in the eyes of=20
venal officials.=E2=80=99=20

A non-German of Hitler=E2=80=99s intellectual level would in some=20
ways write quite differently. Germany was a land of high general=20
culture, with the largest reading public of any country in the=20
world. In the lower middle class, there was a tremendous educa=C2=AC=20
tional urge. People who in other countries would read light=20
novels and popular magazines devoured works on art, science,=20
history, and above all philosophy. Certain philosophical phrases=20
became journalistic cliches. Hitler is forever speaking of =E2=80=98con=C2=
=AC=20
cepts,=E2=80=99 of things =E2=80=98as such=E2=80=99 (an sich ). Moreover, h=
e is constantly at=20
pains to show that he, too, is cultured. Hence the long, intricate=20
sentences in which he frequently gets lost ; hence such sententious=20
bombast as the opening lines of Chapter Ten.=20

The absence of movement and development in Mein Kampf=20
is surely connected with Hitler=E2=80=99s lack of concern for the objective=
=20
world. But its stylistic expression, the preponderance of sub=C2=AC=20
stantives over verbs, again shows the influence of German journal=C2=AC=20
ism. Many German writers, including some academicians, seem=20
to feel that the substantive is the strongest and most impressive=20
part of speech. This tendency is found even in German police=20


Translator=E2=80=99s Note=20


xm=20


reports. Instead of saying that a man was arrested, they will=20
say that his arrest took place. This predilection for substantives=20
is a salient feature of Hitler=E2=80=99s style.=20

Here and there, amid his ponderous reflections, Hitler is sud=C2=AC=20
denly shaken with rage. He casts off his intellectual baggage and=20
writes a speech, eloquent and vulgar.=20

# # #=20

Most of Hitler=E2=80=99s stylistic peculiarities represent no problem for=
=20
the translator. The mixed metaphors are just as mixed in one=20
language as in the other. A lapse of grammatical logic can occur=20
in any language. An English-language Hitler might be just as=20
redundant as the German one; a half-educated writer, without=20
clear ideas, generally feels that to say a thing only once is rather=20
slight.=20

There are, however, certain traits of Hitler=E2=80=99s style that are=20
peculiarly German and do present a problem in translation.=20
Chief among these are the length of the sentences, the substan=C2=AC=20
tives, and the German particles.=20

A translation must not necessarily be good English, but it=20
must be English such as some sort of English author =E2=80=94 in this=20
case, let us say, a poor one =E2=80=94 might write. On the other hand,=20
it would be wrong to make Hitler an English-speaking rabble-=20
rouser, because his very style is necessarily German.=20

No non-German would write such labyrinthine sentences. The=20
translator=E2=80=99s task =E2=80=94 often a feat of tightrope-walking =E2=
=80=94 is to=20
render the ponderousness and even convey a German flavor,=20
without writing German-American. In general I have cut down=20
the sentences only when the length made them unintelligible in=20
English. (The German language with its cases and genders does=20
enable the reader to find his way through tangles which in a=20
non-inflected language would be inextricable.) Contrary to the=20
general opinion, the German text contains only one or two sen=C2=AC=20
tences that make no sense at first reading.=20

The substantives are a different matter. Here it has been=20




XIV=20


Translator=E2=80=99s Note=20


necessary to make greater changes, because in many cases the=20
use of verbal nouns is simply incompatible with the English lan=C2=AC=20
guage. No pedant, no demagogue, no police clerk writes that=20
way. I have used the construction where it seemed conceivable=20
in English, elsewhere reluctantly abandoned it. German stylists=20
may say that Hitler=E2=80=99s piling up of substantives is bad German,=20
but the fact remains that numerous German writers do the same=20
thing, while this failing is almost non-existent in English.=20

In approaching Hitler=E2=80=99s use of particles, it must be remembered=20
that he was at home in the Lower Bavarian dialect. Even with=C2=AC=20
out the dialect, much German prose, some not of the worst=20
quality, abounds in these useless little words: wohl, ja, denn,=20
schon, noch , eigentlich , etc. The South Germans are especially=20
addicted to them, and half of Hitler=E2=80=99s sentences are positively=20
clogged with particles, not to mention such private favorites as=20
besonders and damals which he strews about quite needlessly.=20
His particles even have a certain political significance, for in the=20
petit bourgeois mind they are, like carved furniture, an embodi=C2=AC=20
ment of the home-grown German virtues, while their avoidance=20
is viewed with suspicion as foreign and modernistic. Unfortu=C2=AC=20
nately, they must largely be sacrificed in translation. There are=20
no English equivalents, and an attempt to translate them results=20
in something like the language of the Katzenjammer Kids.=20
Sometimes, however, it is possible to give a similar impression=20
of wordiness by other means.=20

INTRODUCTION=20


For years Mein KampJ stood as proof of the blindness and=20
complacency of the world. For in its pages Hitler announced =E2=80=94=20
long before he came to power =E2=80=94 a program of blood and terror=20
in a self-revelation of such overwhelming frankness that few=20
among its readers had the courage to believe it. Once again it=20
was demonstrated that there was no more effective method of=20
concealment than the broadest publicity.=20

Mein Kampf was written in white-hot hatred. But this hatred=20
was aimed, not at the author=E2=80=99s enemies, but at his supposed=20
friends. The book is an oratorical denunciation of collaborators=20
who largely shared the political aim of the author, but refused=20
to accept his methods.=20

As the discussion goes on, the tone of the debate grows louder=20
and more impassioned. For to Hitler the only principle which=20
really counts is his claim to supreme leadership, and when this=20
claim is disputed by people whom, in his loveless soul, he secretly=20
despises, he is driven half mad with hatred.=20

It was in 1922 that Hitler first planned a small pamphlet the=20
title of which was to be Eine Abrechnung (=E2=80=98Settling Accounts=E2=80=
=99).=20
He wanted to prove that the leaders of the German right wing=20
parties were wrong in their methods, lacked strength, imagina=C2=AC=20
tion, and political judgment, and were bound to fail. He dis=C2=AC=20
cussed the booklet at length with his close friends, Rudolf Hess=20
and Dietrich Eckart. Eckart himself had compiled a little book=20
from his talks with Hitler. Its title was Bolshevism from Moses=20
to Lenin , and it attempted to prove that Judaism was the great=20
destructive force which had ruined Western civilization. The=20
book was brilliantly written, and, although it claimed to express=20
Hitler=E2=80=99s ideas, these were expounded in a way which was more=20
Eckart=E2=80=99s than Hitler=E2=80=99s.=20

Hitler must have realized the growing necessity of stating his=20
own principles in his own language, in a more definite, more=20




XVI=20


Introduction=20


authoritative form. He probably had an uneasy feeling that=20
some of his followers, although admiring him as an orator, did=20
not believe him to be a clear or profound thinker. People whom=20
he himself regarded as his inferiors endeavored to outline what=20
they called the fundamental principles of his own party, and=20
quarreled about these principles over the head of their leader.=20

Gottfried Feder, who had collaborated in drafting the party=E2=80=99s=20
program, and who considered himself the master-mind of the=20
whole movement, wrote a booklet about the aims of Naziism.=20
In it he insisted strongly on his own particular ideas, and laid=20
stress on economic principles that were distinctly socialistic,=20
such as abolition of capital interest. At the same time, Alfred=20
Rosenberg, Hitler=E2=80=99s mentor, published an equally =E2=80=98authentic=
=E2=80=99=20
comment on the party aims differing sharply from Feder=E2=80=99s.=20
Rosenberg insisted on certain racial and sociological aspects of=20
the issue, such as the inequality of men, and the superiority of=20
the Nordic or Aryan type.=20

True, Feder and Rosenberg had one thing in common: both=20
attacked the Jews. But their points of view were entirely differ=C2=AC=20
ent. To Feder, the Jews were profiteers in a vicious economic=20
system. To Rosenberg, they were the creators of the modern=20
world, the standard-bearers of the twentieth century and of all=20
that he and his fellows hated: freedom of speech and press,=20
egalitarian justice, representative government, free access of=20
every citizen to all professions and public services without dis=C2=AC=20
crimination of birth, wealth, or religion. The decisive factor in=20
human society was, to Rosenberg, the outstanding personality,=20
the great lone wolf, the creative superman. This idea was not=20
new, but it well fitted Hitler=E2=80=99s purpose, for, at that time, demo=
=C2=AC=20
cratic and dictatorial tendencies still struggled side by side in=20
the Nazi movement, and men like Feder claimed to be Hitler=E2=80=99s=20
equals.=20

To settle these disturbing quarrels between his followers, to=20
strengthen his own authority as leader and idea-man of his=20
movement, Hitler decided to broaden the scope of his projected=20
book, and to add the story of his life, brushing up to heroic size=20


Introduction=20


XVII=20


the picture of his inglorious youth, and picturing himself as one=20
whose boyhood had been marred by poverty, but who had risen=20
by his own strength and intelligence to be the leader of a great=20
political party, thus making himself a symbol of the humiliated=20
but unconquerable German people and a victim of the same=20
social forces which he was then attacking.=20

But the main aim of his book was to show that he was the=20
only founder and builder of the National Socialist movement. He=20
never mentions the name of Captain Ernst Roehm, who con=C2=AC=20
tributed at least as much as himself to the rise of the party.=20
He says little about Anton Drexler, the real founder of the move=C2=AC=20
ment. He makes no mention of Hermann Esser and gives no=20
idea of the indispensable role played by Julius Streicher. His=20
only reference to Gregor Strasser, his most powerful rival for=20
the party leadership, is an obscure joke about his predilection=20
for card-playing. Strasser is never mentioned by name.=20

After the unsuccessful putsch of November, 1923, Hitler spent=20
about thirteen months in a so-called prison. There he wrote=20
most of what later became the first volume of his famous book.=20
He intended to call it, =E2=80=98A Four and One-Half Year Struggle=20
against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice: Settling Accounts with=20
the Destroyers of the National Socialist Movement/ His idea=20
was to tell the inside story of his putsch and its collapse. But=20
then he dropped this plan and the title lost its meaning. It seems=20
that one of his associates, Max Amann, had the idea of simply=20
calling the whole Mein Kampf (=E2=80=98My Struggle=E2=80=99). The subtitle =
of=20
the first volume remained Eine Abrechnung (=E2=80=98Settling Accounts=E2=80=
=99),=20
although it no longer made sense.=20

The first volume was dictated by the author to two men who=20
were in prison with him. One was Emil Maurice, a strong-arm=20
man not too well fitted for the j=E2=80=98ob. Then came Rudolf Hess,=20
who had escaped to Austria, returned, was arrested, and went=20
to the same prison as his master. Together they finished the=20
first volume. Hess has often been called a disciple of Karl=20
Haushofer, the military geographer. No doubt Haushofer influ=C2=AC=20
enced some parts of Mein Kampf , but it is misleading to represent=20




XVUl=20


Introduction=20


him as Hitler=E2=80=99s guiding genius. The essential parts of the book=20
do not concern questions of foreign policy or military geography,=20
but of race, propaganda, and political education.=20

The first volume was published in the fall of 1925. It dis=C2=AC=20
appointed many readers, who had expected a revelation or at=20
least a dramatic story, not a philosophy; ill-founded, undocu=C2=AC=20
mented, and badly written. =E2=80=98Many=E2=80=99 readers, incidentally, sh=
ould=20
not be taken too literally. It is true that Amann claimed at that=20
time to have sold twenty-three thousand copies during the first=20
year, but this is a very doubtful boast. The average party mem=C2=AC=20
ber did not read the book, and among the leaders it was a com=C2=AC=20
mon saying that Hitler was an extraordinary speaker, a great=20
leader, a political genius, but =E2=80=98it=E2=80=99s too bad he had to wri=
te that=20
silly book.=E2=80=99=20

The second edition of the first volume, and the second volume=20
from the beginning, were supervised by one Josef Cerny, at that=20
time staff member of the Volkischer Beobachter , the party paper.=20
The text became somewhat more civilized. The difference be=C2=AC=20
tween the first edition and the later ones is not as great as is=20
often believed. The most important of these differences con=C2=AC=20
cerns the structure of the Nazi Party. When Hitler published=20
the first edition of the first volume, the Nazi Party was still a=20
democratic organization which elected officials. Two years=20
later the =E2=80=98leader-principle/ or dictatorship within the party,=20
was firmly established. Hitler had reached the goal for which=20
the whole book was written. The =E2=80=98 unalterable =E2=80=99 program of =
the=20
party, the so-called twenty-five points, called for a =E2=80=98central parl=
i=C2=AC=20
ament=E2=80=99 as the highest authority of the future Nazi state. The=20
first edition of Mein Kampf had to accept this principle. The=20
second edition changed all that. From now on the party aim was=20
definitely set toward dictatorship.=20

The second volume came out in December, 1926, and was=20
read by even fewer people than the first; certainly by none out=C2=AC=20
side the still small National Socialist Party. For some years=20
to come the book remained a financial burden on the shoulders=20
of Max Amann, Hitler=E2=80=99s business manager. Amann had been=20


Introduction=20


xix=20


appointed, in 1925, manager of the Franz Eher Verlag, the party=E2=80=99s=
=20
publishing house virtually owned by Hitler, and to this day=20
he has remained at the head of this source of Hitler=E2=80=99s private=20
fortune. He knew that Hitler needed financial resources in order=20
to control the party effectively; he saw it more clearly than Hitler=20
himself, who has no sense for business. Amann hoped that the=20
book would become a source of private revenue. Two or three=20
years before Hitler came to power, the sales of Mein Kampf=20
began to rise, and later they rose astronomically. Amann went=20
on printing the book from the same poor type, on the. same=20
cheap paper as before. Everybody was forced to buy it. It was=20
presented as a gift to newly-wed couples, but the license fee=20
was doubled. Mein Kampf made Hitler rich. It became a=20
best-seller second only to the Bible.=20

The book may well be called a kind of satanic Bible. To the=20
author =E2=80=94 although he was shrewd enough not to state it explicitly=
=20
himself, but to have it said by his spiritual adviser, Alfred Rosen=C2=AC=
=20
berg =E2=80=94 the belief in human equality is a kind of hypnotic spell=20
exercised by world-conquering Judaism with the help of the=20

of liberal democracy; in the last stage Marxism was their tool.=20
By preaching the principle of human equality, Judaism has at=C2=AC=20
tempted to extirpate the feeling of pride from the soul of the Aryan=20
race, to rob them of their leadership. To give back to these noble=20
races their former consciousness of superiority by inculcating=20
the principle that men are not equal is the theoretical purpose=20
of Mein Kampf.=20

Compared to the spirit of the book, the pragmatical parts are=20
of less importance. Nevertheless, they have aroused more in=C2=AC=20

=20
most readers flung themselves upon these passages after the=20
author had become a leading actor on the world stage. But a=20
little reflection would show that in the pathless field of politics=20
you cannot follow a schedule. When Hitler set down his plans=20
for a future foreign policy, he was a mere schemer. Adolf Hitler,=20

Introduction=20


the author of Mein Kampf, was not yet Adolf Hitler, the Fiihrer=20
of Germany; he lacked the experience, the responsibilities, the=20
knowledge. In fact, he was nothing more than an organizer of=20
street fights, an impresario of mass meetings, the leader of a=20
virtually non-existent party, who shrewdly gambled with rival=20
leaders of similar unimportance.=20

The soundest appraisal of these utterances on foreign policy=20
was made by Adolf Hitler himself, in the course of a libel suit in=20
Munich. To a fat and bored judge, who, staring through gold-=20
rimmed spectacles, meditated whether to fine both parties five=20
hundred or a thousand marks, Adolf Hitler explained: =E2=80=98In political=
=20
life there is no such thing as principles of foreign policy. The=20
programmatic principles of my party are its doctrine on the=20
racial problem and its fight against pacifism and international=C2=AC=20
ism. But foreign policy in itself is merely a means to an end.=20
In questions of foreign policy I shall never admit that I am tied=20
by anything/ Nevertheless, Mein Kampf is packed with prin=C2=AC=20
ciples of foreign policy, all of which have been taken more seri=C2=AC=20
ously by others than by the author himself.=20

What gives Mein Kampf its terrific import is not the aims but=20
the methods. Whether Hitler proclaims war against Russia or=20
friendship with Britain, a crusade against the United States or a=20
plot with Japan, conquest by land or by sea, revolt against the=20
rich or the poor =E2=80=94 all these plans and schemes mean nothing.=20
He has changed them again and again, because =E2=80=98in questions of=20
foreign policy I never shall admit that I am tied by anything/=20
But the fact that all of his schemes, even his friendships, mean=20
bloodshed (=E2=80=98an alliance which does not imply the intention of=20
going to war would be meaningless =E2=80=99) =E2=80=94 that is what gives t=
his=20
foreign policy its sinister significance. Whether he speaks of=20
art, of education, of economics, he always sees blood. He does=20
not like a certain kind of artist or educator, and that will be=20
reason enough to kill them. =E2=80=98We shall do away with them radi=C2=AC=
=20
cally/ this is his typical slogan. The light-heartedness with which=20
he threatens murder at the slightest provocation is perhaps even=20
more frightful than the threats themselves.=20

That such a man could go so far toward realizing his ambitions,=20

In the House of My Parents=20


T=20

Aoday it seems to me providential that=20
Fate should have chosen Braunau on the Inn as my birthplace.=20
For this little town lies on the boundary between two German=20
states which we of the younger generation at least have made it=20
our life work to reunite by every means at our disposal.=20

German-Austria must return to the great German mother=20
country, and not because of any economic considerations. No,=20
and again no: even if such a union were unimportant from an=20
economic point of view; yes, even if it were harmful, it must=20
nevertheless take place. One blood demands one Reich. Never=20
will the German nation possess the moral right to engage in=20
colonial politics until, at least, it embraces its own sons within a=20
single state. Only when the Reich borders include the very last=20
German, but can no longer guarantee his daily bread, will the=20
moral right to acquire foreign soil arise from the distress of our=20
own people. Their sword will become our plow, and from the=20
tears of war the daily bread of future generations will grow.=20
And so this little city on the border seems to me the symbol of a=20
great mission. And in another respect as well, it looms as an=20
admonition to the present day. More than a hundred years ago,=20
this insignificant place had the distinction of being immortalized=20
in the annals at least of German history, for it was the scene of a=20
tragic catastrophe which gripped the entire German nation. At=20

the time of our fatherland=E2=80=99s deepest humiliation, Johannes Palm 1=
=20
of Nuremberg, burgher, bookseller, uncompromising nationalist=20
and French hater, died there for the Germany which he loved so=20
passionately even in her misfortune. He had stubbornly refused=20
to denounce his accomplices, who were in fact his superiors. In=20
this he resembled Leo Schlageter . 2 And like him, he was de=C2=AC=20
nounced to the French by a representative of his government.=20
An Augsburg police chief won this unenviable fame, thus furnish=C2=AC=20
ing an example for our modern German officials in Herr Sever-=20

In this little town on the Inn, gilded by the rays of German=20
martyrdom, Bavarian by blood, technically Austrian , 4 lived my=20
parents in the late eighties of the past century; my father a=20
dutiful civil servant, my mother giving all her being to the house=C2=AC=20
hold, and devoted above all to us children in eternal, loving care.=20
Little remains in my memory of this period, for after a few years=20
my father had to leave the little border city he had learned to=20
love, moving down the Inn to take a new position in Passau, that=20
is, in Germany proper.=20

In those days constant moving was the lot of an Austrian cus=C2=AC=20
toms official. A short time later, my father was sent to Linz, and=20
there he was finally pensioned. Yet, indeed, this was not to=20
mean =E2=80=98rest=E2=80=99 for the old gentleman. In his younger days, as =
the=20
son of a poor cottager, he couldn=E2=80=99t bear to stay at home. Before=20

1 Johann Philipp Palm was executed in 1806 by the French garrison of=20
Nuremberg for publishing a pamphlet attacking Napoleon.=20

2 A free corps leader who performed acts of sabotage against the French=20
occupation authorities in the Ruhr. In the summer of 1923 he was cap=C2=AC=
=20
tured by the French authorities, court-martialed and shot.=20

3 With brief interruptions the Social Democrat Carl Severing was Prussian=
=20
Minister of the Interior from 1920 until 1932, when Chancellor Von Papen=20
dissolved the Prussian government. As Minister of the Interior he was in=20
charge of the Prussian police. This, coupled with the fact that he successf=
ully=20
combated the influence of the Rightist secret leagues in the Reichswehr,=20
earned him the special hatred of the Nazis.=20

The Little Ringleader=20

he was even thirteen, the little boy laced his tiny knapsack and=20
ran away from his home in the Waldviertel . 1 Despite the at=C2=AC=20
tempts of =E2=80=98 experienced=E2=80=99 villagers to dissuade him, he made=
 his=20
way to Vienna, there to learn a trade. This was in the fifties of=20
the past century. A desperate decision, to take to the road with=20
only three gulden for travel money, and plunge into the un=C2=AC=20
known. By the time the thirteen-year-old grew to be seventeen,=20
he had passed his apprentice=E2=80=99s examination, but he was not yet=20
content. On the contrary. The long period of hardship, endless=20
misery, and suffering he had gone through strengthened his de=C2=AC=20
termination to give up his trade and become =E2=80=98 something better.=E2=
=80=99=20
Formerly the poor boy had regarded the priest as the embodi=C2=AC=20
ment of all humanly attainable heights; now in the big city,=20
which had so greatly widened his perspective, it was the rank of=20
civil servant. With all the tenacity of a young man whom suffer=C2=AC=20
ing and care had made =E2=80=98 old =E2=80=99 while still half a child, the=
 seventeen-=20
year-old clung to his new decision =E2=80=94 he did enter the civil service=
.=20
And after nearly twenty-three years, I believe, he reached his=20
goal. Thus he seemed to have fulfilled a vow which he had made=20
as a poor boy: that he would not return to his beloved native=20
village until he had made something of himself.=20

His goal was achieved; but no one in the village could remember=20
the little boy of former days, and to him the village had grown=20
strange.=20

When finally, at the age of fifty-six, he went into retirement,=20
he could not bear to spend a single day of his leisure in idleness.=20
Near the Upper Austrian market village of Lambach he bought=20
a farm, which he worked himself, and thus, in the circuit of a=20
long and industrious life, returned to the origins of his forefathers.=20

It was at this time that the first ideals took shape in my breast.=20
All my playing about in the open, the long walk to school, and=20
particularly my association with extremely =E2=80=98husky=E2=80=99 boys, wh=
ich=20
sometimes caused my mother bitter anguish, made me the very=20
opposite of a stay-at-home. And though at that time I scarcely=20

had any serious ideas as to the profession I should one day pursue,=20
my sympathies were in any case not in the direction of my father=E2=80=99s=
=20
career. I believe that even then my oratorical talent was being=20
developed in the form of more or less violent arguments with my=20
schoolmates. I had become a little ringleader; at school I learned=20
easily and at that time very well, but was otherwise rather hard=20
to handle. Since in my free time I received singing lessons in the=20
cloister at Lambach, I had excellent opportunity to intoxicate=20
myself with the solemn splendor of the brilliant church festivals.=20
As was only natural, the abbot seemed to me, as the village=20
priest had once seemed to my father, the highest and most de=C2=AC=20
sirable ideal. For a time, at least, this was the case. But since=20
my father, for understandable reasons, proved unable to appreci=C2=AC=20
ate the oratorical talents of his pugnacious boy, or to draw from=20
them any favorable conclusions regarding the future of his off=C2=AC=20
spring, he could, it goes wdthout saying, achieve no understanding=20
for such youthful ideas. With concern he observed this conflict=20
of nature.=20

As it happened, my temporary aspiration for this profession=20
was in any case soon to vanish, making place for hopes more=20
suited to my temperament. Rummaging through my father=E2=80=99s=20
library, I had come across various books of a military nature,=20
among them a popular edition of the Franco-German War of=20
1870-71. 1 It consisted of two issues of an illustrated periodical=20
from those years, which now became my favorite reading matter.=20
It was not long before the great heroic struggle had become my=20
greatest inner experience. From then on I became more and more=20
enthusiastic about everything that was in any way connected=20
with war or, for that matter, with soldiering.=20

But in another respect as well, this was to assume importance for=20
me. For the first time, though as yet in a confused form, the ques=C2=AC=20
tion was forced upon my consciousness: Was there a difference=20
=E2=80=94 and if so what difference =E2=80=94 between the Germans who fough=
t=20
these battles and other Germans? Why hadn=E2=80=99t Austria taken=20
part in this war; why hadn=E2=80=99t my father and all the others fought?=

Are we not the same as all other Germans?=20

Do we not all belong together? This problem began to gnaw=20
at my little brain for the first time. I asked cautious questions=20
and with secret envy received the answer that not every German=20
was fortunate enough to belong to Bismarck=E2=80=99s Reich.,=20

This was more than I could understand.=20

* * *=20


It was decided that I should go to high school.=20

From my whole nature, and to an even greater degree from my=20
temperament, my father believed he could draw the inference=20
that the humanistic Gymnasium 1 would represent a conflict with=20
my talents. A Realschule seemed to him more suitable. In this=20
opinion he was especially strengthened by my obvious aptitude=20
for drawing; a subject which in his opinion was neglected in the=20
Austrian Gymnasiums. Another factor may have been his own=20
laborious career which made humanistic study seem impractical=20
in his eyes, and therefore less desirable. It was his basic opinion=20
and intention 2 that, like himself, his son would and must be=C2=AC=20
come a civil servant. It was only natural that the hardships of=20
his youth should enhance his subsequent achievement in his eyes,=20
particularly since it resulted exclusively from his own energy and=20
iron diligence. It was the pride of the self-made man which made=20
him want his son to rise to the same position in life, or, of course,=20
even higher if possible, especially since, by his own industrious=20
life, he thought he would be able to facilitate his child=E2=80=99s develop=
=C2=AC=20
ment so greatly.=20

It was simply inconceivable to him that I might reject what=20

8=20


Mein Kampf=20


had become the content of his whole life. Consequently, my=20
father=E2=80=99s decision was simple, definite, and clear; in his own eyes =
I=20
mean, of course. Finally, a whole lifetime spent in the bitter=20
struggle for existence had given him a domineering nature, and=20
it would have seemed intolerable to him to leave the final decision=20
in such matters to an inexperienced boy, having as yet no sense=20
of responsibility. Moreover, this would have seemed a sinful and=20
reprehensible weakness in the exercise of his proper parental=20
authority and responsibility for the future life of his child, and,=20
as such, absolutely incompatible with his concept of duty.=20

And yet things were to turn out differently.=20

Then barely eleven years old, I was forced into opposition for=20
the first time in my life. Hard and determined as my father=20
might be in putting through plans and purposes once conceived,=20
his son was just as persistent and recalcitrant in rejecting an idea=20
which appealed to him not at all, or in any case very little.=20

I did not want to become a civil servant.=20

Neither persuasion nor =E2=80=98serious=E2=80=99 arguments made any im=C2=
=AC=20
pression on my resistance. I did not want to be a civil servant,=20
no, and again no. All attempts on my father=E2=80=99s part to inspire=20
me with love or pleasure in this profession by stories from his=20
own life accomplished the exact opposite. I yawned and grew=20
sick to my stomach at the thought of sitting in an office, deprived=20
of my liberty; ceasing to be master of my own time and being=20
compelled to force the content of a whole life into blanks that had=20
to be filled out. 1=20

And what thoughts could this prospect arouse in a boy who in=20
reality was really anything but =E2=80=98good=E2=80=99 in the usual sense o=
f the=20
word? School work was ridiculously easy, leaving me so much=20
free time that the sun saw more of me than my room. When=20

A Civil Servant =E2=80=94 Never!=20


9=20


of the memories of those happy days still remains with me.=20
Woods and meadows were then the battlefields on which the=20
=E2=80=98 conflicts =E2=80=99 which exist everywhere in life were decided.=
=20

In this respect my attendance at the Realschule , which now=20
commenced, made little difference.=20

But now, to be sure, there was a new conflict to be fought out.=20

As long as my father=E2=80=99s intention of making me a civil servant=20
encountered only my theoretical distaste for the profession, the=20
conflict was bearable. Thus far, I had to some extent been able=20
to keep my private opinions to myself; I did not always have to=20
contradict him immediately. My own firm determination never=20
to become a civil servant sufficed to give me complete inner peace.=20
And this decision in me was immutable. The problem became=20
more difficult when I developed a plan of my own in opposition=20
to my father=E2=80=99s. And this occurred at the early age of twelve.=20
How it happened, I myself do not know, but one day it became=20
clear to me that I would become a painter, an artist. There was=20
no doubt as to my talent for drawing; it had been one of my=20
father=E2=80=99s reasons for sending me to the 1Realschule, but never in al=
 T=20
the world would it have occurred to him to give me professional=20
training in this direction. On the contrary. When for the first=20
time, after once again rejecting my father=E2=80=99s favorite notion, I was=
=20
asked what I myself wanted to be, and I rather abruptly blurted=20
out the decision I had meanwhile made, my father for the moment=20
was struck speechless.=20

=E2=80=98Painter? Artist?=E2=80=99=20

He doubted my sanity, or perhaps he thought he had heard=20
wrong or misunderstood me. But when he was clear on the sub=C2=AC=20
ject, and particularly after he felt the seriousness of my intention,=20
he opposed it with all the determination of his nature. His de=C2=AC=20
cision was extremely simple, for any consideration of what=20
abilities I might really have was simply out of the question.=20

=E2=80=98Artist, no, never as long as I live!=E2=80=99 But since his son, a=
mong=20
various other qualities, had apparently inherited his father=E2=80=99s=20
stubbornness, the same answer came back at him. Except, of=20
course, that it was in the opposite sense.=20


10=20


Mein Kampf=20


And thus the situation remained on both sides. My father did=20
not depart from his =E2=80=98Never!=E2=80=99 And I intensified my =E2=80=98=
Oh, yes!=E2=80=99=20

The consequences, indeed, were none too pleasant. The old=20
man grew embittered, and, much as I loved him, so did I. My=20
father forbade me to nourish the slightest hope of ever being al=C2=AC=20
lowed to study art. I went one step further and declared that if=20
that was the case I would stop studying altogether. As a result=20
of such =E2=80=98pronouncements,=E2=80=99 of course, I drew the short end; =
the=20
old man began the relentless enforcement of his authority. In the=20
future, therefore, I was silent, but transformed my threat into=20
reality. I thought that once my father saw how little progress I=20
was making at the Realschule , he would let me devote myself to=20
my dream, whether he liked it or not.=20

I do not know whether this calculation was correct. For the=20
moment only one thing was certain: my obvious lack of success=20
at school. What gave me pleasure I learned, especially every=C2=AC=20
thing which, in my opinion, I should later need as a painter.=20
What seemed to me unimportant in this respect or was otherwise=20
unattractive to me, I sabotaged completely. My report cards at=20
this time, depending on the subject and my estimation of it,=20
showed nothing but extremes. Side by side with =E2=80=98laudable=E2=80=99 a=
nd=20

=80=98inadequate.=E2=80=99 By far my=20
best accomplishments were in geography and even more so in=20
history. These were my favorite subjects, in which I led the=20
class.=20

If now, after so many years, I examine the results of this period,=20
I regard two outstanding facts as particularly significant:=20

First: I became a nationalist}=20

Second: I learned to understand and grasp the meaning of history .=20

Old Austria was a =E2=80=98 state of nationalities .=E2=80=99=20

1 Hitler=E2=80=99s early nationalism had, of course, nothing to do with Aus=
trian=20
patriotism, but was the Pan-Germanism of the Los-von-Rom (Away-from-=20
Rome) movement founded by Ritter Georg von Schonerer. It stood for=20
union of Germany with the German parts of Austria and must be distin=C2=AC=
=20
guished from the Pan-German movement of Germany, which was an out-=20
and-out conspiracy for German world domination. Schonerer=E2=80=99s movemen=
t=20
was strongly anti-Semitic.=20


The German Ostmark=20


11=20


By and large, a subject of the German Reich, at that time at=20
least, was absolutely unable to grasp the significance of this fact=20
for the life of the individual in such a state. After the great=20
victorious campaign of the heroic armies in the Franco-German=20
War, people had gradually lost interest in the Germans living=20
abroad; some could not, while others were unable to appreciate=20
their importance. 1 Especially with regard to the German-=20
Austrians, the degenerate dynasty was only too frequently=20
confused with the people, which at the core was robust and=20
healthy.=20

What they failed to appreciate was that, unless the German in=20
Austria had really been of the best blood, he would never have=20
had the power to set his stamp on a nation of fifty-two million=20
souls to such a degree that, even in Germany, the erroneous=20
opinion could arise that Austria was a German state. This was=20
an absurdity fraught with the direst consequences, and yet a=20
glowing testimonial to the ten million Germans in the Ostmark. 2=20
Only a handful of Germans in the Reich had the slightest con=C2=AC=20
ception of the eternal and merciless struggle for the German=20
language, German schools, and a German way of life. Only to=C2=AC=20
day, when the same deplorable misery is forced on many millions=20
of Germans from the Reich, who under foreign rule dream of=20
their common fatherland and strive, amid their longing, at least=20
to preserve their holy right to their mother tongue, do wider=20
circles understand what it means to be forced to fight for one=E2=80=99s=20
nationality. Today perhaps some can appreciate the greatness of=20
the Germans in the Reich=E2=80=99s old Ostmark , who, with no one but=20

time when the Reich was highly interested in colonies, but not=20
in its own flesh and blood at its very doorstep.=20

As everywhere and always, in every struggle, there were, in=20
this fight for the language in old Austria, three strata:=20

The fighters , the lukewarm , and the traitors.=20

This sifting process began at school. For the remarkable fact=20
about the language struggle is that its waves strike hardest per=C2=AC=20
haps in the school, since it is the seed-bed of the coming genera=C2=AC=20
tion. It is a struggle for the soul of the child, and to the child its=20
first appeal is addressed:=20

=E2=80=98 German boy, do not forget you are a German,=E2=80=99 and, =E2=80=
=98 Little=20
girl, remember that you are to become a German mother.=E2=80=99=20

Anyone who knows the soul of youth will be able to understand=20
that it is they who lend ear most joyfully to such a battle-cry.=20
They carry on this struggle in hundreds of forms, in their own=20
way and with their own weapons. They refuse to sing un-=20
German songs. The more anyone tries to alienate them from=20
German heroic grandeur, the wilder becomes their enthusiasm:=20
they go hungry to save pennies for the grown-ups=E2=80=99 battle fund;=20
their ears are amazingly sensitive to un-German teachers, and at=20
the same time they are incredibly resistant; they wear the for=C2=AC=20
bidden insignia of their own nationality and are happy to be=20
punished or even beaten for it. Thus, on a small scale they are a=20
faithful reflection of the adults, except that often their convic=C2=AC=20
tions are better and more honest.=20

I, too. while still comparatively young, had an opportunity to=20
take part in the struggle of nationalities in old Austria. Col=C2=AC=20
lections were taken for the Siidmark 1 and the school association;=20
we emphasized our convictions by wearing corn-flowers 2 and red,=20
black, and gold colors; =E2=80=98Heil=E2=80=99 was our greeting, and instea=
d of the=20

1 Siidmark. Another term for Austria. Apparently devised in imitation=20
of the old imperial Marks by the Vereinfur Deutschtum im Ausland , founded=
=20
in 1881 to defend the endangered nationality of Germans in the border=20
territories.=20

2 The corn-flower was the emblem of Germans loyal to the imperial House=20
of Hohenzollern and of the Austrian Pan-Germans.=20


The Struggle for Germanism=20


13=20


imperial anthem we sang =E2=80=98Deutschland iiher Alles / despite warn=C2=
=AC=20
ings and punishments. In this way the child received political=20
training in a period when as a rule the subject of a so-called na=C2=AC=20
tional state knew little more of his nationality than its language.=20
It goes without saying that even then I was not among the luke=C2=AC=20
warm. In a short time I had become a fanatical =E2=80=98 German=20
Nationalist/ though the term was not identical with our present=20
party concept.=20

This development in me made rapid progress; by the time I=20
was fifteen I understood the difference between dynastic =E2=80=98 patriot=
=C2=AC=20
ism =E2=80=99 and folkish 1 =E2=80=98 nationalism y ; and even then I was i=
nterested=20
only in the latter.=20

For anyone who has never taken the trouble to study the inner=20
conditions of the Habsburg monarchy, such a process may not=20
be entirely understandable. In this country the instruction in=20
world history had to provide the germ for this development,=20
since to all intents and purposes there is no such thing as a=20
specifically Austrian history. The destiny of this state is so much=20
bound up with the life and development of all the Germans that=20
a separation of history into German and Austrian does not seem=20
conceivable. Indeed, when at length Germany began to divide=20
into two spheres of power, this division itself became German=20
history.=20

The insignia of former imperial glory, preserved in Vienna, still=20
seem to cast a magic spell; they stand as a pledge that these two=C2=AC=20
fold destinies are eternally one.=20

The elemental cry of the German-Austrian people for union=20
with the German mother country, that arose in the days when the=20
Habsburg state was collapsing, was the result of a longing that=20
slumbered in the heart of the entire people =E2=80=94 a longing to return=
=20
to the never-forgotten ancestral home. But this would be in-=20

1 Volkisch. The word first appeared in nationalist literature about 1875=20
and is merely a Germanization of 1 nationalist.=E2=80=99 Where possible the=
 national=C2=AC=20
ists avoided the use of foreign words. Since 1900 it has been in wide use=
=20
among nationalist circles, from the Pan-German League down to the Na=C2=AC=
=20
tional Socialists.=20


14=20


Mein Kampf=20


explicable if the historical education of the individual German-=20
Austrian had not given rise to so general a longing. In it lies a=20
well which never grows dry; which, especially in times of forget=C2=AC=20
fulness, transcends all momentary prosperity and by constant=20
reminders of the past whispers softly of a new future.=20

Instruction in world history in the so-called high schools is even=20
today in a very sorry condition. Few teachers understand that=20
the aim of studying history can never be to learn historical dates=20
and events by heart and recite them by rote; that what matters is=20
not whether the child knows exactly when this or that battle was=20
fought, when a general was born, or even when a monarch (usually=20
a very insignificant one) came into the crown of his forefathers.=20
No, by the living God, this is very unimportant.=20

To Team=E2=80=99 history means to seek and find the forces which=20
are the causes leading to those effects which we subsequently per=C2=AC=20
ceive as historical events.=20

The art of reading as of learning is this: to retain the essential,=20
to forget the non-essential.=20

Perhaps it affected my whole later life that good fortune sent=20
me a history teacher who was one of the few to observe this=20
principle in teaching and examining. Dr. Leopold Potsch, my=20
professor at the Realschule in Linz, embodied this requirement to=20
an ideal degree. This old gentleman=E2=80=99s manner was as kind as it=20
was determined, his dazzling eloquence not only held us spell=C2=AC=20
bound but actually carried us away. Even today I think back=20
with gentle emotion on this gray-haired man who, by the fire of=20
his narratives, sometimes made us forget the present; who, as if=20
by enchantment, carried us into past times and, out of the millen=C2=AC=20
nial veils of mist, molded dry historical memories into living=20
reality. On such occasions we sat there, often aflame with en=C2=AC=20
thusiasm, and sometimes even moved to tears.=20

What made our good fortune all the greater was that this=20
teacher knew how to illuminate the past by examples from the=20
present, and how from the past to draw inferences for the present.=20
As a result he had more understanding than anyone else for all=20
the daily problems which then held us breathless. He used our=20


l=20


Enthusiasm for History=20


15=20


budding nationalistic fanaticism as a means of educating us,=20
frequently appealing to our sense of national honor. By this=20
alone he was able to discipline us little ruffians more easily than=20
would have been possible by any other means.=20

This teacher made history my favorite subject.=20

And indeed, though he had no such intention, it was then that=20
I became a little revolutionary.=20

For who could have studied German history under such a=20
teacher without becoming an enemy of the state which, through=20
its ruling house, exerted so disastrous an influence on the destinies=20
of the nation?=20

And who could retain his loyalty to a dynasty which in past=20
and present betrayed the needs of the German people again and=20
again for shameless private advantage?=20

Did we not know, even as little boys, that this Austrian state=20
had and could have no love for us Germans?=20

Our historical knowledge of the works of the House of Habs-=20
burg was reinforced by our daily experience. In the north and=20
south the poison of foreign nations gnawed at the body of our=20
nationality, and even Vienna was visibly becoming more and=20
more of an un-German city. The Royal House Czechized wher=C2=AC=20
ever possible, and it was the hand of the goddess of eternal jus=C2=AC=20
tice and inexorable retribution which caused Archduke Francis=20
Ferdinand, the most mortal enemy of Austrian-Germanism, to=20
fall by the bullets which he himself had helped to mold. For=20
had he not been the patron of Austria=E2=80=99s Slavization from=20
above!=20

Immense were the burdens which the German people were ex=C2=AC=20
pected to bear, inconceivable their sacrifices in taxes and blood,=20
and yet anyone who was not totally blind was bound to recognize=20
that all this would be in vain. What pained us most was the fact=20
that this entire system was morally whitewashed by the alliance=20
with Germany, with the result that the slow extermination of=20
Germanism in the old monarchy was in a certain sense sanctioned=20
by Germany itself. The Habsburg hypocrisy, which enabled the=20
Austrian rulers to create the outward appearance that Austria=20


16=20


Mein Kampf=20


was a German state, raised the hatred toward this house to flam=C2=AC=20
ing indignation and at the same time =E2=80=94 contempt.=20

Only in the Reich itself, the men who even then were called to=20
power saw nothing of all this. As though stricken with blindness,=20
they lived by the side of a corpse, and in the symptoms of rotten=C2=AC=20
ness saw only the signs of =E2=80=98 new =E2=80=99 life.=20

The unholy alliance of the young Reich and the Austrian sham=20
state contained the germ of the subsequent World War and of=20
the collapse as well.=20

In the course of this book I shall have occasion to take up this=20
problem at length. Here it suffices to state that even in my earli=C2=AC=20
est youth I came to the basic insight which never left me, but=20
only became more profound:=20

That Germanism could be safeguarded only by the destruction of=20
Austria , and , furthermore , that national sentiment is in no sense=20
identical with dynastic patriotism; that above all the House of Hobs -=20
burg was destined to be the misfortune of the German nation.=20

Even then I had drawn the consequences from this realization:=20
ardent love for my German-Austrian homeland, deep hatred for=20
the Austrian state.=20


# # #=20

The habit of historical thinking which I thus learned in school=20
has never left me in the intervening years. To an ever-increasing=20
extent world history became for me an inexhaustible source of=20
understanding for the historical events of the present; in other=20
words, for politics. I do not want to =E2=80=98learn=E2=80=99 it, I want it=
 to in=C2=AC=20
struct me.=20

Thus, at an early age, I had become a political =E2=80=98revolutionary/=20
and I became an artistic revolutionary at an equally early age.=20

The provincial capital of Upper Austria had at that time a=20
theater which was, relatively speaking, not bad. Pretty much of=20
everything was produced. At the age of twelve I saw Wilhelm=20
Tell for the first time, and a few months later my first opera,=20


Veneration of Wagner=20


17=20


Lohengrin . I was captivated at once. My youthful enthusiasm=20
for the master of Bayreuth knew no bounds. Again and again I=20
was drawn to his works, and it still seems to me especially fortu=C2=AC=20
nate that the modest provincial performance left me open to an=20
intensified experience later on.=20

All this, particularly after I had outgrown my adolescence=20
(which in my case was an especially painful process), reinforced=20
my profound distaste for the profession which my father had=20
chosen for me. My conviction grew stronger and stronger that I=20
would never be happy as a civil servant. The fact that by this=20
time my gift for drawing had been recognized at the Realschule=20
made my determination all the firmer.=20

Neither pleas nor threats could change it one bit.=20

I wanted to become a painter and no power in the world could=20
make me a civil servant.=20

Yet, strange as it may seem, with the passing years I became=20
more and more interested in architecture.=20

At that time I regarded this as a natural complement to my=20
gift as a painter, and only rejoiced inwardly at the extension of=20
my artistic scope.=20

I did not suspect that things would turn out differently.=20


=E2=96=A07v* T=20

The question of my profession was to be decided more quickly=20
than I had previously expected.=20

In my thirteenth year I suddenly lost my father. A stroke of=20
apoplexy felled the old gentleman who was otherwise so hale,=20
thus painlessly ending his earthly pilgrimage, plunging us all into=20
the depths of grief. His most ardent desire had been to help his=20
son forge his career, thus preserving him from his own bitter=20
experience. In this, to all appearances, he had not succeeded.=20
But, though unwittingly, he had sown the seed for a future which=20
at that time neither he nor I would have comprehended.=20

For the moment there was no outward change.=20


18=20


Mein Kampf=20


My mother, to be sure, felt obliged to continue my education=20
in accordance with my father=E2=80=99s wish; in other words, to have me=20
study for the civil servant=E2=80=99s career. I, for my part, was more than=
=20
ever determined absolutely not to undertake this career. In pro=C2=AC=20
portion as my schooling departed from my ideal in subject mat=C2=AC=20
ter and curriculum, I became more indifferent at heart. Then=20
suddenly an illness came to my help and in a few weeks decided=20
my future and the eternal domestic quarrel. As a result of my=20
serious lung ailment, a physician advised my mother in most=20
urgent terms never to send me into an office. My attendance at=20
the Realschule had furthermore to be interrupted for at least a=20
year. The goal for which I had so long silently yearned, for which=20
I had always fought, had through this event suddenly become=20
reality almost of its own accord.=20

Concerned over my illness, my mother finally consented to=20
take me out of the Realschule and let me attend the Academy.=20

These were the happiest days of my life and seemed to me al=C2=AC=20
most a dream; and a mere dream it was to remain. Two years=20
later, the death of my mother put a sudden end to all my high-=20
flown plans.=20

It was the conclusion of a long and painful illness which from=20
the beginning left little hope of recovery. Yet it was a dreadful=20
blow=E2=80=99, particularly for me. I had honored my father, but my=20
mother I had loved.=20

Poverty and hard reality now compelled me to take a quick=20
decision. What little my father had left had been largely ex=C2=AC=20
hausted by my mother=E2=80=99s grave illness; the orphan=E2=80=99s pension =
to=20
which I was entitled was not enough for me even to live on, and=20
so I was faced with the problem of somehow making my own=20
living.=20

In my hand a suitcase full of clothes and underwear; in my=20
heart an indomitable will, I journeyed to Vienna. I, too, hoped=20
to wrest from Fate what my father had accomplished fifty years=20
before; I, too, wanted to become =E2=80=98 something =E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 bu=

CHAPTER=20

II=20


Years of Study and Suffering in Vienna=20


my mother died, Fate, at least in=20
one respect, had made its decisions.=20

In the last months of her sickness, I had gone to Vienna to take=20
the entrance examination for the Academy. I had set out with a=20
pile of drawings, convinced that it would be child's play to pass=20
the examination. At the Realschule I had been by far the best in=20
my class at drawing, and since then my ability had developed=20
amazingly; my own satisfaction caused me to take a joyful pride=20
in hoping for the best.=20

Yet sometimes a drop of bitterness put in its appearance: my=20
talent for painting seemed to be excelled by my talent for draw=C2=AC=20
ing, especially in almost all fields of architecture. At the same=20
time my interest in architecture as such increased steadily, and=20
this development was accelerated after a two weeks=E2=80=99 trip to=20
Vienna which I took when not yet sixteen. The purpose of my=20
trip was to study the picture gallery in the Court Museum, but I=20
had eyes for scarcely anything but the Museum itself. From=20
morning until late at night, I ran from one object of interest to=20
another, but it was always the buildings which held my primary=20
interest. For hours I could stand in front of the Opera, for hours=20
I could gaze at the Parliament; the whole Ring Boulevard seemed=20
to me like an enchantment out of The Thousand-cmd-One~ Nights.=20

Now I was in the fair city for the second time, waiting with=20
burning impatience, but also with confident self-assurance, for=20


=E2=9C=93=20


20=20


Mein Kampf=20


the result of my entrance examination. I was so convinced that=20
I would be successful that when I received my rejection, it struck=20
me as a bolt from the blue. Yet that is what happened. When I=20
presented myself to the rector, requesting an explanation for my=20
non-acceptance at the Academy=E2=80=99s school of painting, that gentle=C2=
=AC=20
man assured me that the drawings I had submitted incontrover-=20
tibly showed my unfitness for painting, and that my ability=20
obviously lay in the field of architecture; for me, he said, the=20
Academy=E2=80=99s school of painting was out of the question, the place=20
for me was the School of Architecture. It was incomprehensible=20
to him that I had never attended an architectural school or re=C2=AC=20
ceived any other training in architecture. Downcast, I left von=20
Hansen=E2=80=99s 1 magnificent building on the Schillerplatz, for the first=
=20
time in my young life at odds with myself. For what I had just=20
heard about my abilities seemed like a lightning flash; suddenly=20
revealing a conflict with which I had long been afflicted, although=20
until then I had no clear conception of its why and wherefore.=20

In a few days I myself knew that I should some day become an=20
architect.=20

To be sure, it was an incredibly hard road; for the studies I had=20
neglected out of spite at the Realschule were sorely needed. One=20
could not attend the Academy=E2=80=99s architectural school without=20
having attended the building school at the Technik , and the latter=20
required a high-school degree. I had none of all this. The fulfill=C2=AC=20
ment of my artistic dream seemed physically impossible.=20

When after the death of my mother I went to Vienna for the=20
third time, to remain for many years, the time which had mean=C2=AC=20
while elapsed had restored my calm and determination. My old=20
defiance had come back to me and my goal was now clear and=20
definite before my eyes. I wanted to become an architect, and=20
obstacles do not exist to be surrendered to, but only to be broken.=20
I was determined to overcome these obstacles, keeping before my=20

eyes the image of my father, who had started out as the child of a=20
village shoemaker, and risen by his own efforts to be a govern-=20
ment official. I had a better foundation to build on, and hence=20
my possibilities in the struggle were easier, and what then seemed=20
to be the harshness of Fate, I praise today as wisdom and Provi=C2=AC=20
dence. While the Goddess of Suffering took me in her arms, often=20
threatening to crush me, my will to resistance grew, and in the=20
end this will was victorious.=20

I owe it to that period that I grew hard and am still capable of=20
being hard. And even more, I exalt it for tearing me away from=20
the hollowness of comfortable life; for drawing the mother=E2=80=99s=20
darling out of his soft downy bed and giving him =E2=80=98Dame Care=E2=80=
=99=20
for a new mother; for hurling me, despite all resistance, into a=20
world of misery and poverty, thus making me acquainted with=20
those for whom I was later to fight.=20

In this period my eyes were opened to two menaces of which I=20
had previously scarcely known the names, and whose terrible=20
importance for the existence of the German people I certainly did=20
not understand: Marxism and Jewry.=20

To me Vienna, the city which, to so many, is the epitome of=20
innocent pleasure, a festive playground for merrymakers, repre=C2=AC=20
sents, I am sorry to say, merely the living memory of the saddest=20
period of my life.=20

Even today this city can arouse in me nothing but the most=20
dismal thoughts. For me the name of this Phaeacian city 1 repre=C2=AC=20
sents five years of hardship and misery. Five years in which I=20
was forced to earn a living, first as a day laborer, then as a small=20
painter; a truly meager living which never sufficed to appease=20
even my daily hunger. Hunger was then my faithful bodyguard;=20

he never left me for a moment and partook of all I had, share=20
and share alike. Every book I acquired aroused his interest; a=20
visit to the Opera prompted his attentions for days at a time; my=20
life was a continuous struggle with this pitiless friend. And yet=20
during this time I studied as never before. Aside from my archi=C2=AC=20
tecture and my rare visits to the Opera, paid for in hunger, I had=20
but one pleasure: my books.=20

At that time I read enormously and thoroughly. All the free=20
time my work left me was employed in my studies. In this way I=20
forged in a few years=E2=80=99 time the foundations of a knowledge from=20
which I still draw nourishment today.=20

And even more than this:=20

In this period there took shape within me a world picture and=20
a philosophy which became the granite foundation of all my acts.=20
In addition to what I then created, I have had to learn little; and=20
I have had to alter nothing.=20

On the contrary.=20

Today I am firmly convinced that basically and on the whole=20
all creative ideas appear in our youth, in so far as any such are=20
present. I distinguish between the wisdom of age, consisting=20
solely in greater thoroughness and caution due to the experience=20
of a long life, and the genius of youth, which pours out thoughts=20
and ideas with inexhaustible fertility, but cannot for the moment=20
develop them because of their very abundance. It is this youthful=20
genius which provides the building materials and plans for the=20
future, from which a wiser age takes the stones, carves them and=20
completes the edifice, in so far as the so-called wisdom of age has=20
not stifled the genius of youth.=20

The life which I had hitherto led at home differed little or not=20
at all from the life of other people. Carefree, I could await the=20

For, strange as it may seem at first glance, the cleft between this=20
class, which in an economic sense is by no means so brilliantly=20
situated, and the manual worker is often deeper than we imagine.=20
The reason for this hostility, as we might almost call it, lies in the=20
fear of a social group, which has but recently raised itself above=20
the level of the manual worker, that it will sink back into the old=20
despised class, or at least become identified with it. To this, in=20
many cases, we must add the repugnant memory of the cultural=20

In this respect Fate was kind to me. By forcing me to return=20
to this world of poverty and insecurity, from which my father had=20
risen in the course of his life, it removed the blinders of a narrow=20
petty-bourgeois upbringing from my eyes. Only now did I learn=20
to know humanity, learning to distinguish between empty ap=C2=AC=20

After the turn of the century, Vienna was, socially speaking,=20
one of the most backward cities in Europe.=20

Dazzling riches and loathsome poverty alternated sharply. In=20
the center and in the inner districts you could really feel the pulse=20
of this realm of fifty-two millions, with all the dubious magic of=20


24=20


Mein Kampe=20


the national melting pot. The Court with its dazzling glamour=20
attracted wealth and intelligence from the rest of the country like=20
a magnet. Added to this was the strong centralization of the=20
Habsburg monarchy in itself.=20

It offered the sole possibility of holding this medley of nations=20
together in any set form. But the consequence was an extra=C2=AC=20
ordinary concentration of high authorities in the imperial cap=C2=AC=20
ital.=20

Yet not only in the political and intellectual sense was Vienna=20
the center of the old Danube monarchy, but economically as well.=20
The host of high officers, government officials, artists, and scholars=20
was confronted by an even greater army of workers, and side by=20
side with aristocratic and commercial wealth dwelt dire poverty.=20
Outside the palaces on the Ring loitered thousands of unem=C2=AC=20
ployed, and beneath this Via Triumphalis of old Austria dwelt the=20
homeless in the gloom and mud of the canals.=20

In hardly any German city could the social question have been=20
studied better than in Vienna. But make no mistake. This=20
=E2=80=98studying=E2=80=99 cannot be done from lofty heights. No one who ha=
s=20
not been seized in the jaws of this murderous viper can know its=20
poison fangs. Otherwise nothing results but superficial chatter=20
and false sentimentality. Both are harmful. The former because=20
it can never penetrate to the core of the problem, the latter be=C2=AC=20
cause it passes it by. I do not know which is more terrible: in=C2=AC=20
attention to social misery such as we see every day among the=20
majority of those who have been favored by fortune or who have=20
risen by their own efforts, or else the snobbish, or at times tactless=20
and obtrusive, condescension of certain women of fashion in=20
skirts or in trousers, who Teel for the people.=E2=80=99 In any event, thes=

capable of realizing. Consequently, and much to their own=20
amazement, the result of their social =E2=80=98efforts=E2=80=99 is always n=

quently, in fact, an indignant rebuff; though this, of course, is=20
passed off as a proof of the people=E2=80=99s ingratitude.=20

The actual business of finding work was, as a rule, not hard for=20
me, since I was not a skilled craftsman, but was obliged to seek=20
my daily bread as a so-called helper and sometimes as a casual=20
laborer.=20

I adopted the attitude of all those who shake the dust of Europe=20
from their feet with the irrevocable intention of founding a new=20
existence in the New World and conquering a new home. Re=C2=AC=20
leased from all the old, paralyzing ideas of profession and position,=20
environment and tradition, they snatch at every livelihood that=20
offers itself, grasp at every sort of work, progressing step by step=20
to the realization that honest labor, no matter of what sort, dis=C2=AC=20
graces no one. I, too, was determined to leap into this new world,=20
with both feet, and fight my way through.=20

I soon learned that there was always some kind of work to be=20
had, but equally soon I found out how easy it was to lose it.=20

The uncertainty of earning my daily bread soon seemed to me=20
one of the darkest sides of my new life.=20


26=20


Mein Kampf=20


The 1 skilled' worker does not find himself out on the street as=20
frequently as the unskilled; but he is not entirely immune to this=20
fate either. And in his case the loss of livelihood owing to lack of=20
work is replaced by the lock-out, or by going on strike himself.=20

In this respect the entire economy suffers bitterly from the=20
individual's insecurity in earning his daily bread.=20

The peasant boy who goes to the big city, attracted by the=20
easier nature of the work (real or imaginary), by shorter hours,=20
but most of all by the dazzling light emanating from the metrop=C2=AC=20
olis, is accustomed to a certain security in the matter of liveli=C2=AC=20
hood. He leaves his old job only when there is at least some=20
prospect of a new one. For there is a great lack of agricultural=20
workers, hence the probability of any long period of unemploy=C2=AC=20
ment is in itself small. It is a mistake to believe that the young=20
fellow who goes to the big city is made of poorer stuff than his=20
brother who continues to make an honest living from the peasant=20
sod. No, on the contrary: experience shows that all those ele=C2=AC=20
ments which emigrate consist of the healthiest and most energetic=20
natures, rather than conversely. Yet among these =E2=80=98emigrants'=20
we must count, not only those who go to America, but to an equal=20
degree the young farmhand who resolves to leave his native vil=C2=AC=20
lage for the strange city. He, too, is prepared to face an uncertain=20
fate. As a rule he arrives in the big city with a certain amount of=20
money; he has no need to lose heart on the very first day if he has=20
the ill fortune to find no work for any length of time. But it is=20
worse if, after finding a job, he soon loses it. To find a new one,=20
especially in winter, is often difficult if not impossible. Even so,=20
the first weeks are tolerable. He receives an unemployment bene=C2=AC=20
fit from his union funds and manages as well as possible. But=20
when his last cent is gone and the union, due to the long duration=20
of his unemployment, discontinues its payments, great hardships=20
begin. Now he walks the streets, hungry; often he pawns and=20
sells his last possessions; his clothing becomes more and more=20
wretched; and thus he sinks into external surroundings which, on=20
top of his physical misfortune, also poison his soul. If he is=20
evicted and if (as is so often the case) this occurs in winter, his=20


Fate of the Worker=20


27=20


misery is very great. At length he finds some sort of job again.=20
But the old story is repeated. The same thing happens a second=20
time, the third time perhaps it is even worse, and little by little=20
he learns to bear the eternal insecurity with greater and greater=20
indifference. At last the repetition becomes a habit.=20

And so this man, who was formerly so hard-working, grows lax=20
in his whole view of life and gradually becomes the instrument of=20
those who use him only for their own base advantage. He has so=20
often been unemployed through no fault of his own that one time=20
more or less ceases to matter, even when the aim is no longer to=20
fight for economic rights, but to destroy political, social, or cul=C2=AC=
=20
tural values in general. He may not be exactly enthusiastic=20
about strikes, but at any rate he has become indifferent.=20

With open eyes I was able to follow this process in a thousand=20
examples. The more I witnessed it, the greater grew my revulsion=20
for the big city which first avidly sucked men in and then so=20
cruelly crushed them.=20

When they arrived, they belonged to their people; after re=C2=AC=20
maining for a few years, they were lost to it.=20

I, too, had been tossed around by life in the metropolis; in my=20
own skin I could feel the effects of this fate and taste them with=20
my soul. One more thing I saw: the rapid change from work to=20
unemployment and vice versa, plus the resultant fluctuation of=20
income, end by destroying in many all feeling for thrift, or any=20
understanding for a prudent ordering of their lives. It would=20
seem that the body gradually becomes accustomed to living on=20
the fat of the land in good times and going hungry in bad times.=20
Indeed, hunger destroys any resolution for reasonable budgeting=20
in better times to come by holding up to the eyes of its tormented=20
victim an eternal mirage of good living and raising this dream=20
to such a pitch of longing that a pathological desire puts an end=20
to all restraint as soon as wages and earnings make it at all pos=C2=AC=20
sible. The consequence is that once the man obtains work he=20
irresponsibly forgets all ideas of order and discipline, and begins=20
to live luxuriously for the pleasures of the moment. This upsets=20
even the small weekly budget, as even here any intelligent ap-=20


28=20


Mein Kampe=20


portionment is lacking; in the beginning it suffices for five days=20
instead of seven, later only for three, finally scarcely for one day,=20
and in the end it is drunk up in the very first night.=20

Often he has a wife and children at home. Sometimes they, too,=20
are infected by this life, especially when the man is good to them=20
on the whole and actually loves them in his own way. Then the=20
weekly wage is used up by the whole family in two or three days;=20
they eat and drink as long as the money holds out and the last=20
days they go hungry. Then the wdfe drags herself out into the=20
neighborhood, borrows a little, runs up little debts at the food=20
store, and in this way strives to get through the hard last days of=20
the week. At noon they all sit together before their meager and=20
sometimes empty bowls, waiting for the next payday, speaking=20
of it, making plans, and, in their hunger, dreaming of the happi=C2=AC=20
ness to come.=20

And so the little children, in their earliest beginnings, are made=20
familiar with this misery.=20

It ends badly if the man goes his own way from the very be=C2=AC=20
ginning and the woman, for the children=E2=80=99s sake, opposes him.=20
Then there is fighting and quarreling, and, as the man grows=20
estranged from his wife, he becomes more intimate with alcohol.=20
He is drunk every Saturday, and, with her instinct of self-=20
preservation for herself and her children, the woman has to fight=20
to get even a few pennies out of him; and, to make matters worse,=20
this usually occurs on his way from the factory to the barroom.=20
When at length he comes home on Sunday or even Monday night,=20
drunk and brutal, but always parted from his last cent, such=20
scenes often occur that God have mercy!=20

I have seen this in hundreds of instances. At first I was re=C2=AC=20
pelled or even outraged, but later I understood the whole tragedy=20
of this misery and its deeper causes. These people are the un=C2=AC=20
fortunate victims of bad conditions!=20

Even more dismal in those days were the housing conditions.=20
The misery in which the Viennese day laborer lived was frightful=20
to behold. Even today it fills me with horror when I think of=20
these wretched caverns, the lodging houses and tenements, sordid=20
scenes of garbage, repulsive filth, and worse.=20


Fate of the Worker=20

What was =E2=80=94 and still is =E2=80=94 bound to happen some day, when=20
the stream of unleashed slaves pours forth from these miserable=20
dens to avenge themselves on their thoughtless fellow men!=20

For thoughtless they are!=20

Thoughtlessly they let things slide along, and with their utter=20
lack of intuition fail even to suspect that sooner or later Fate=20
must bring retribution, unless men conciliate Fate while there is=20
still time.=20

How thankful I am today to the Providence which sent me to=20
that school! In it I could no longer sabotage the subjects I did=20
not like. It educated me quickly and thoroughly.=20

If I did not wish to despair of the men who constituted my=20
environment at that time, I had to learn to distinguish between=20
their external characters and lives and the foundations of their=20
development. Only then could all this be borne without losing=20
heart. Then, from all the misery and despair, from all the filth=20
and outward degeneration, it was no longer human beings that=20
emerged, but the deplorable results of deplorable laws; and the=20
hardship of my own life, no easier than the others, preserved me=20
from capitulating in tearful sentimentality to the degenerate=20
products of this process of development.=20

No, this is not the way to understand all these things!=20

Even then I saw that only a twofold road could lead to the goal=20
of improving these conditions:=20

The deepest sense of social responsibility for the creation of better=20
foundations for our development , coupled with brutal determination=20
in breaking down incurable tumors.=20

Just as Nature does not concentrate her greatest attention in=20
preserving what exists, but in breeding offspring to carry on the=20
species, likewise, in human life, it is less important artificially to=20
alleviate existing evil, which, in view of human nature, is ninety-=20
nine per cent impossible, than to ensure from the start healthier=20
channels for a future development.=20

During my struggle for existence in Vienna, it had become clear=20
to me that=20

Social activity must never and on no account be directed toward=20


30=20


Mein Kampf=20


philanthropic flim-flam , but rather toward the elimination of the=20
basic deficiencies in the organization of our economic and cultural=20
life that must =E2=80=94 or at all events can =E2=80=94 lead to the degener=
ation of the=20
individual.=20

The difficulty of applying the most extreme and brutal methods=20
against the criminals who endanger the state lies not least in the=20
uncertainty of our judgment of the inner motives or causes of=20
such contemporary phenomena.=20

This uncertainty is only too well founded in our own sense of=20
guilt regarding such tragedies of degeneration; be that as it may,=20
it paralyzes any serious and firm decision and is thus partly re=C2=AC=20
sponsible for the weak and half-hearted, because hesitant, execu=C2=AC=20
tion of even the most necessary measures of self-preservation.=20

Only when an epoch ceases to be haunted by the shadow of its=20
own consciousness of guilt will it achieve the inner calm and=20
outward strength brutally and ruthlessly to prune off the wild=20
shoots and tear out the weeds.=20

Since the Austrian state had practically no social legislation or=20
jurisprudence, its weakness in combating even malignant tumors=20
was glaring.=20


# # #=20

I do not know what horrified me most at that time: the eco=C2=AC=20
nomic misery of my companions, their moral and ethical coarse=C2=AC=20
ness, or the low level of their intellectual development.=20

How often does our bourgeoisie rise in high moral indignation=20
when they hear some miserable tramp declare that it is all the=20
same to him whether he is a German or not, that he feels equally=20
happy wherever he is, as long as he has enough to live on!=20

This lack of =E2=80=98 national pride =E2=80=99 is most profoundly deplored=
, and=20
horror at such an attitude is expressed in no uncertain terms.=20

How many people have asked themselves what was the real=20
reason for the superiority of their own sentiments?=20

ories of the greatness of our national fatherland in all the fields of=20
cultural and artistic life, whose total result is to inspire them with=20
just pride at being members of a nation so blessed?=20

How many suspect to how great an extent pride in the father-=20
land depends on knowledge of its greatness in all these fields?=20

Do our bourgeois circles ever stop to consider to what an ab=C2=AC=20
surdly small extent this prerequisite of pride in the fatherland is=20
transmitted to the =E2=80=98people=E2=80=99?=20

Let us not try to condone this by saying that =E2=80=98it is no better in=
=20
other countries,=E2=80=99 and that in those countries the worker avows his=
=20
nationality =E2=80=98notwithstanding.=E2=80=99 Even if this were so, it cou=
ld=20
serve as no excuse for our own omissions. But it is not so; for the=20
thing that we constantly designate as =E2=80=98chauvinistic=E2=80=99 educat=
ion,=20
for example among the French people, is nothing other than ex=C2=AC=20
treme emphasis on the greatness of France in all the fields of=20
culture, or, as the Frenchman puts it, of =E2=80=98civilization.=E2=80=99 T=
he fact=20
is that the young Frenchman is not brought up to be objective,=20
but is instilled with the most subjective conceivable view, in so=20
far as the importance of the political or cultural greatness of his=20
fatherland is concerned.=20

This education will always have to be limited to general and=20
extremely broad values which, if necessary, must be engraved in=20
the memory and feeling of the people by eternal repetition.=20

But to the negative sin of omission is added in our country the=20
positive destruction of the little which the individual has the=20
good fortune to learn in school. The rats that politically poison=20
our nation gnaw even this little from the heart and memory of=20
the broad masses, in so far as this has not been previously ac=C2=AC=20
complished by poverty and suffering.=20

Imagine, for instance, the following scene:=20

In a basement apartment, consisting of two stuffy rooms,=20
dwells a worker=E2=80=99s family of seven. Among the five children there=20
is a boy of, let us assume, three years. This is the age in which the=20
first impressions are made on the consciousness of the child.=20
Talented persons retain traces of memory from this period down=20
to advanced old age. The very narrowness and overcrowding of=20


32=20


Mein Kampf=20


the room does not lead to favorable conditions. Quarreling and=20
wrangling will very frequently arise as a result. In these circum=C2=AC=20
stances, people do not live with one another, they press against=20
one another. Every argument, even the most trifling, which in a=20
spacious apartment can be reconciled by a mild segregation, thus=20
solving itself, here leads to loathsome wrangling without end.=20
Among the children, of course, this is still bearable; they always=20
fight under such circumstances, and among themselves they=20
quickly and thoroughly forget about it. But if this battle is car=C2=AC=20
ried on between the parents themselves, and almost every day in=20
forms which for vulgarity often leave nothing to be desired, then,=20
if only very gradually, the results of such visual instruction must=20
ultimately become apparent in the children. The character they=20
will inevitably assume if this mutual quarrel takes the form of=20
brutal attacks of the father against the mother, of drunken=20
beatings, is hard for anyone who does not know this milieu to=20
imagine. At the age of six the pitiable little boy suspects the=20
existence of things which can inspire even an adult with nothing=20
but horror. Morally poisoned, physically undernourished, his=20
poor little head full of lice, the young =E2=80=98citizen=E2=80=99 goes off=
 to public=20
school. After a great struggle he may learn to read and write, but=20
that is about all. His doing any homework is out of the question.=20
On the contrary, the very mother and father, even in the presence=20
of the children, talk about his teacher and school in terms which=20
are not fit to be repeated, and are more inclined to curse the=20
latter to their face than to take their little offspring across their=20
knees and teach them some sense. All the other things that the=20
little fellow hears at home do not tend to increase his respect for=20
his dear fellow men. Nothing good remains of humanity, no in=C2=AC=20
stitution remains unassailed; beginning with his teacher and up=20
to the head of the government, whether it is a question of religion=20
or of morality as such, of the state or society, it is all the same,=20
everything is reviled in the most obscene terms and dragged into=20
the filth of the basest possible outlook. When at the age of=20
fourteen the young man is discharged from school, it is hard to=20
decide what is stronger in him: his incredible stupidity as far as=20

any real knowledge and ability are concerned, or the corrosive=20
insolence of his behavior, combined with an immorality, even at=20
this age, which would make your hair stand on end.=20

What position can this man =E2=80=94 to whom even now hardly=20
anything is holy, who, just as he has encountered no greatness,=20
conversely suspects and knows all the sordidness of life =E2=80=94 occupy=
=20
in the life into which he is now preparing to emerge?=20

The three-year-old child has become a fifteen-year-old despiser=20
of all authority. Thus far, aside from dirt and filth, this young=20
man has seen nothing which might inspire him to any higher=20
enthusiasm.=20

But only now does he enter the real university of this existence.=20

Now he begins the same life which all along his childhood=20
years 1 he has seen his father living. He hangs around the street=20
corners and bars, coming home God knows when; and for a=20
change now and then he beats the broken-down being which was=20
once his mother, curses God and the world, and at length is con=C2=AC=20
victed of some particular offense and sent to a house of correction.=20

There he receives his last polish.=20

And his dear bourgeois fellow men are utterly amazed at the=20

Day by day, in the theater and in the movies, in backstairs=20

parallel to my future profession. Moreover, I was master of my=20
own time and could apportion it better than had previously been=20
possible.=20

I painted to make a living and studied for pleasure.=20

Thus I was able to supplement my visual instruction in the=20
social problem by theoretical study. I studied more or less all of=20
the books I was able to obtain regarding this whole field, and for=20
the rest immersed myself in my own thoughts.=20

I believe that those who knew me in those days took me for an=20
eccentric.=20

Amid all this, as was only natural, I served my love of archi=C2=AC=20
tecture with ardent zeal. Along with music, it seemed to me the=20
queen of the arts: under such circumstances my concern with it=20
was not =E2=80=98work/ but the greatest pleasure. I could read and draw=20


The Art of Reading=20


35=20


until late into the night, and never grow tired. Thus my faith=20
grew that my beautiful dream for the future would become reality=20
after all, even though this might require long years. I was firmly=20
convinced that I should some day make a name for myself as an=20
architect.=20

In addition, I had the greatest interest in everything con=C2=AC=20
nected with politics, but this did not seem to me very significant.=20
On the contrary: in my eyes this was the self-evident duty of=20
every thinking man. Anyone who failed to understand this lost=20
the right to any criticism or complaint.=20

In this field, too, I read and studied much.=20

By =E2=80=98reading,=E2=80=99 to be sure, I mean perhaps something differen=
t=20
than the average member of our so-called =E2=80=98intelligentsia.=E2=80=99=
=20

I know people who =E2=80=98read=E2=80=99 enormously, book for book, letter=

for letter, yet whom I would not describe as =E2=80=98well-read.=E2=80=99 T=

le to=20

the art of sifting what is valuable for them in a book from that=20
which is without value, of retaining the one forever, and, if pos=C2=AC=20
sible, not even seeing the rest, but in any case not dragging it=20
around with them as useless ballast. For reading is no end in=20
itself, but a means to an end. It should primarily help to fill the=20
framework constituted by every man=E2=80=99s talents and abilities; in=20
addition, it should provide the tools and building materials=20
which the individual needs for his life=E2=80=99s work, regardless whether=
=20
this consists in a primitive struggle for sustenance or the satis=C2=AC=20
faction of a high calling; secondly, it should transmit a general=20
world view. In both cases, however, it is essential that the con=C2=AC=20
tent of what one reads at any time should not be transmitted to=20
the memory in the sequence of the book or books, but like the=20
stone of a mosaic should fit into the general world picture in its=20
proper place, and thus help to form this picture in the mind of=20
the reader. Otherwise there arises a confused muddle of memo=C2=AC=20
rized facts which not only are worthless, but also make their un=C2=AC=20
fortunate possessor conceited. For such a reader now believes=20
himself in all seriousness to be =E2=80=98educated,=E2=80=99 to understand =
some-=20


36=20


Mein Kampf=20


thing of life, to have knowledge, while in reality, with every new=20
acquisition of this kind of =E2=80=98education/ he is growing more and=20
more removed from the world until, not infrequently, he ends=20
up in a sanitarium or in parliament.=20

Never will such a mind succeed in culling from the confusion of=20
his =E2=80=98 knowledge =E2=80=99 anything that suits the demands of the ho=
ur, for=20
his intellectual ballast is not organized along the lines of life, but=20
in the sequence of the books as he read them and as their content=20
has piled up in his brain. If Fate, in the requirements of his daily=20
life, desired to remind him to make a correct application of what=20
he had read, it would have to indicate title and page number,=20
since the poor fool would otherwise never in all his life find the=20
correct place. But since Fate does not do this, these bright boys=20
in any critical situation come into the most terrible embarrass=C2=AC=20
ment, cast about convulsively for analogous cases, and with=20
mortal certainty naturally find the wrong formulas.=20

If this were not true, it would be impossible for us to under=C2=AC=20
stand the political behavior of our learned and highly placed=20
government heroes, unless we decided to assume outright vil=C2=AC=20
lainy instead of pathological propensities.=20

On the other hand, a man who possesses the art of correct=20
reading will, in studying any book, magazine, or pamphlet, in=C2=AC=20
stinctively and immediately perceive everything which in his=20
opinion is worth permanently remembering, either because it is=20
suited to his purpose or generally worth knowing. Once the=20
knowledge he has achieved in this fashion is correctly coordinated=20
within the somehow existing picture of this or that subject created=20
by the imagination, it will function either as a corrective or a=20
complement, thus enhancing either the correctness or the clarity=20
of the picture. Then, if life suddenly sets some question before us=20
for examination or answer, the memory, if this method of reading=20
is observed, will immediately take the existing picture as a norm,=20
and from it will derive all the individual items regarding these=20
questions, assembled in the course of decades, submit them to=20
the mind for examination and reconsideration, until the question=20
is clarified or answered.=20


Social Democracy=20


37=20


Only this kind of reading has meaning and purpose.=20

An orator, for example, who does not thus provide his intelli=C2=AC=20
gence with the necessary foundation will never be in a position=20
cogently to defend his view in the face of opposition, though it=20
may be a thousand times true or real. In every discussion his=20
memory will treacherously leave him in the lurch; he will find=20
neither grounds for reinforcing his own contentions nor any for=20
confuting those of his adversary. If, as in the case of a speaker,=20
it is only a question of making a fool of himself personally, it may=20
not be so bad, but not so when Fate predestines such a know-it-=20
all incompetent to be the leader of a state.=20

Since my earliest youth I have endeavored to read in the correct=20
way, and in this endeavor I have been most happily supported=20
by my memory and intelligence. Viewed in this light, my Vienna=20
period was especially fertile and valuable. The experiences of=20
daily life provided stimulation for a constantly renewed study=20
of the most varied problems. Thus at last I was in a position to=20
bolster up reality by theory and test theory by reality, and was=20
preserved from being stifled by theory or growing banal through=20
reality.=20

In this period the experience of daily life directed and stimu=C2=AC=20
lated me to the most thorough theoretical study of two questions=20
in addition to the social question.=20

Who knows when I would have immersed myself in the doc=C2=AC=20
trines and essence of Marxism if that period had not literally=20
thrust my nose into the problem!=20

# # #=20

What I knew of Social Democracy in my youth was exceed=C2=AC=20
ingly little and very inaccurate.=20

I was profoundly pleased that it should carry on the struggle=20
for universal suffrage and the secret ballot. For even then my=20
intelligence told me that this must help to weaken the Habsburg=20
regime which I so hated. In the conviction that the Austrian=20


38=20


Mein Kampe=20


Empire could never be preserved except by victimizing its Ger=C2=AC=20
mans, but that even the price of a gradual Slavization of the=20
German element by no means provided a guaranty of an empire=20
really capable of survival, since the power of the Slavs to uphold=20
the state must be estimated as exceedingly dubious, I welcomed=20
every development which in my opinion would inevitably lead=20
to the collapse of this impossible state which condemned ten=20
million Germans to death. The more the linguistic Babel cor=C2=AC=20
roded and disorganized parliament, the closer drew the inevitable=20
hour of the disintegration of this Babylonian Empire, and with=20
it the hour of freedom for my German-Austrian people. Only in=20
this way could the Anschluss with the old mother country be=20
restored.=20

Consequently, this activity of the Social Democracy was not=20
displeasing to me. And the fact that it strove to improve the=20
living conditions of the worker, as, in my innocence, I was still=20
stupid enough to believe, likewise seemed to speak rather for it=20
than against it. What most repelled me was its hostile attitude=20
toward the struggle for the preservation of Germanism, its dis=C2=AC=20
graceful courting of the Slavic =E2=80=98 comrade/ who accepted this=20
declaration of love in so far as it was bound up with practical=20
concessions, but otherwise maintained a lofty and arrogant re=C2=AC=20
serve, thus giving the obtrusive beggars their deserved reward.=20

Thus, at the age of seventeen the word =E2=80=98 Marxism =E2=80=99 was as y=
et=20
little known to me, while =E2=80=98Social Democracy=E2=80=99 and socialism=
=20
seemed to me identical concepts. Here again it required the fist=20
of Fate to open my eyes to this unprecedented betrayal of the=20
peoples.=20

Up to that time I had known the Social Democratic Party only=20
as an onlooker at a few mass demonstrations, without possessing=20
even the slightest insight into the mentality of its adherents or=20
the nature of its doctrine; but now, at one stroke, I came into=20
contact with the products of its education and =E2=80=98philosophy.=E2=80=
=99=20
And in a few months I obtained what might otherwise have re=C2=AC=20
quired decades: an understanding of a pestilential whore, 1 cloak-=20

39=20


ing herself as social virtue and brotherly love, from which I hope=20
humanity will rid this earth with the greatest dispatch, since=20
otherwise the earth might well become rid of humanity.=20

My first encounter with the Social Democrats occurred during=20
my employment as a building worker.=20

From the very beginning it was none too pleasant. My clothing=20
was still more or less in order, my speech cultivated, and my=20
manner reserved. I was still so busy with my own destiny that=20
I could not concern myself much with the people around me. I=20
looked for work only to avoid starvation, only to obtain an op=C2=AC=20
portunity of continuing my education, though ever so slowly.=20
Perhaps I would not have concerned myself at all with my new=20
environment if on the third or fourth day an event had not taken=20
place which forced me at once to take a position. I was asked to=20
join the organization.=20

My knowledge of trade-union organization was at that time=20
practically non-existent. I could not have proved that its exist=C2=AC=20
ence was either beneficial or harmful. When I was told that I=20
had to join, I refused. The reason I gave was that I did not un=C2=AC=20
derstand the matter, but that I would not let myself be forced=20
into anything. Perhaps my first reason accounts for my not being=20
thrown out at once. They may perhaps have hoped to convert=20
me or break down my resistance in a few days. In any event,=20
they had made a big mistake. At the end of two weeks I could=20
no longer have joined, even if I had wanted to. In these two=20
weeks I came to know the men around me more closely, and no=20
power in the world could have moved me to join an organization=20
whose members had meanwhile come to appear to me in so un=C2=AC=20
favorable a light.=20

During the first days I was irritable.=20

At noon some of the workers went to the near-by taverns while=20
others remained at the building site and ate a lunch which, as a rule,=20
was quite wretched. These were the married men whose wives=20
brought them their noonday soup in pathetic bowls. Toward=20
the end of the week their number always increased, why I did not=20
understand until later. On these occasions politics was discussed.=20


40=20


Mein Kampf=20


I drank my bottle of milk and ate my piece of bread somewhere=20
off to one side, and cautiously studied my new associates or re=C2=AC=20
flected on my miserable lot. Nevertheless, I heard more than=20
enough; and often it seemed to me that they purposely moved=20
closer to me, perhaps in order to make me take a position. In=20
any case, what I heard was of such a nature as to infuriate me in=20
the extreme. These men rejected everything: the nation as an=20
invention of the =E2=80=98 capitalistic =E2=80=99 (how often was I forced t=
o hear this=20
single word!) classes; the fatherland as an instrument of the=20
bourgeoisie for the exploitation of the working class; the authority=20
of law as a means for oppressing the proletariat; the school as an=20
institution for breeding slaves and slaveholders; religion as a=20
means for stultifying the people and making them easier to ex=C2=AC=20
ploit; morality as a symptom of stupid, sheeplike patience, etc.=20
There was absolutely nothing which was not drawn -through the=20
mud of a terrifying depth. 1=20

At first I tried to keep silent. But at length it became impos=C2=AC=20
sible. I began to take a position and to oppose them. But I was=20
forced to recognize that this was utterly hopeless until I possessed=20
certain definite knowledge of the controversial points. And so I=20
began to examine the sources from which they drew this sup=C2=AC=20
posed wisdom. I studied book after book, pamphlet after pam=C2=AC=20
phlet.=20

From then on our discussions at work were often very heated.=20
I argued back, from day to day better informed than my an=C2=AC=20
tagonists concerning their own knowledge, until one day they=20
made use of the weapon which most readily conquers reason:=20
terror and violence. A few of the spokesmen on the opposing side=20
forced me either to leave the building at once or be thrown off the=20
scaffolding. Since I was alone and resistance seemed hopeless, I=20
preferred, richer by one experience, to follow the former counsel.=20

I went away filled with disgust, but at the same time so agi=C2=AC=20
tated that it would have been utterly impossible for me to turn=20
my back on the whole business. No, after the first surge of in=C2=AC=20
dignation, my stubbornness regained the upper hand. I was=20

1 1 In den Kot einer entsetzlichen Tiefed=20


Social-Democratic Press=20


41=20


determined to go to work on another building in spite of my=20
experience. In this decision I was reinforced by Poverty which,=20
a few weeks later, after I had spent what little I had saved from=20
my wages, enfolded me in her heartless arms. I had to go back=20
whether I wanted to or not. The same old story began anew and=20
ended very much the same as the first time.=20

I wrestled with my innermost soul: are these people human,=20
worthy to belong to a great nation?=20

A painful question; for if it is answered in the affirmative, the=20
struggle for my nationality really ceases to be worth the hard=C2=AC=20
ships and sacrifices which the best of us have to make for the=20
sake of such scum; and if it is answered in the negative, our na=C2=AC=20
tion is pitifully poor in human beings.=20

On such days of reflection and cogitation, I pondered with=20
anxious concern on the masses of those no longer belonging to=20
their people and saw them swelling to the proportions of a=20
menacing army.=20

With what changed feeling I now gazed at the endless columns=20
of a mass demonstration of Viennese workers that took place one=20
day as they marched past four abreast! For nearly two hours I=20
stood there watching with bated breath the gigantic human=20
dragon slowly winding by. In oppressed anxiety, I finally left the=20
place and sauntered homeward. In a tobacco shop on the way 1=20
saw the Arbeiier-Zeitung , the central organ of the old Austrian=20
Social Democracy. It was available in a cheap people=E2=80=99s cafe, to=20
which I often went to read newspapers; but up to that time I had=20
not been able to bring myself to spend more than two minutes on=20
the miserable sheet, whose whole tone affected me like moral=20
vitriol. Depressed by the demonstration, I was driven on by an=20
inner voice to buy the sheet and read it carefully. That evening=20
I did so, fighting down the fury that rose up in me from time to=20
time at this concentrated solution of lies.=20

More than any theoretical literature, my daily reading of the=20
Social Democratic press enabled me to study the inner nature of=20
these thought-processes.=20

For what a difference between the glittering phrases about free-=20


42=20


Mein Kampf=20


dom, beauty, and dignity in the theoretical literature, the de=C2=AC=20
lusive welter of words seemingly expressing the most profound=20
and laborious wisdom, the loathsome humanitarian morality =E2=80=94=20
all this written with the incredible gall that comes with prophetic=20
certainty =E2=80=94 and the brutal daily press, shunning no villainy,=20
employing every means of slander, lying with a virtuosity that=20
would bend iron beams, all in the name of this gospel of a new=20
humanity. The one is addressed to the simpletons of the middle,=20
not to mention the upper, educated, =E2=80=98 classes/ the other to the=20
masses.=20

For me immersion in the literature and press of this doctrine=20
and organization meant finding my way back to my own people.=20

What had seemed to me an unbridgable gulf became the source=20
of a greater love than ever before.=20

Only a fool can behold the work of this villainous poisoner and=20
still condemn the victim. The more independent I made myself=20
in the next few years, the clearer grew my perspective, hence my=20
insight into the inner causes of the Social Democratic successes.=20
I now understood the significance of the brutal demand that I=20
read only Red papers, attend only Red meetings, read only Red=20
books, etc. With plastic clarity I saw before my eyes the in=C2=AC=20
evitable result of this doctrine of intolerance.=20

The psyche of the great masses is not receptive to anything=20
that is half-hearted and weak.=20

Like the woman, whose psychic state is determined less by=20
grounds of abstract reason than by an indefinable emotional=20
longing for a force which will complement her nature, and who,=20
consequently, would rather bow to a strong man than dominate=20
a weakling, likewise the masses love a commander more than a=20
petitioner and feel inwardly more satisfied by a doctrine, tolerat=C2=AC=20
ing no other beside itself, than by the granting of liberalistic=20
freedom with which, as a rule, they can do little, and are prone=20
to feel that they have been abandoned. They are equally un=C2=AC=20
aware of their shameless spiritual terrorization and the hideous=20
abuse of their human freedom, for they absolutely fail to suspect=20
the inner insanity of the whole doctrine. All they see is the^ruth-=20


Social-Democratic Tactics=20


43=20


less force and brutality of its calculated manifestations, to which=20
they always submit in the end.=20

If Social Democracy is opposed by a doctrine of greater truth , but=20
equal brutality of methods , the latter will conquer , though this may=20
require the bitterest struggle.=20

Before two years had passed, the theory as well as the technical=20
methods of Social Democracy were clear to me.=20

I understood the infamous spiritual terror which this move=C2=AC=20
ment exerts, particularly on the bourgeoisie, which is neither=20
morally nor mentally equal to such attacks; at a given sign it=20
unleashes a veritable barrage of lies and slanders against what=C2=AC=20
ever adversary seems most dangerous, until the nerves of the at=C2=AC=20
tacked persons break down and, just to have peace again, they=20
sacrifice the hated individual.=20

However, the fools obtain no peace.=20

The game begins again and is repeated over and over until=20
fear of the mad dog results in suggestive paralysis.=20

Since the Social Democrats best know the value of force from=20
their own experience, they most violently attack those in whose=20
nature they detect any of this substance which is so rare. Con=C2=AC=20
versely, they praise every weakling on the opposing side, some=C2=AC=20
times cautiously, sometimes loudly, depending on the real or=20
supposed quality of his intelligence.=20

They fear an impotent, spineless genius less than a forceful=20
nature of moderate intelligence.=20

But with the greatest enthusiasm they commend weaklings in=20
both mind and force.=20

They know how to create the illusion that this is the only way=20
of preserving the peace, and at the same time, stealthily but=20
steadily, they conquer one position after another, sometimes by=20
silent blackmail, sometimes by actual theft, at moments when the=20
general attention is directed toward other matters, a,nd either=20
does not want to be disturbed or considers the matter too small=20
to raise a stir about, thus again irritating the vicious antagonist.=20

This is a tactic based on precise calculation of all human weak=C2=AC=20
nesses, and its result will lead to success with almost mathe-=20


44=20


Mein Kampf=20


matical certainty unless the opposing side learns to combat poison=20
gas with poison gas.=20

It is our duty to inform' all weaklings that this is a question of=20
to be or not to be.=20

I achieved an equal understanding of the importance of physi=C2=AC=20
cal terror toward the individual and the masses.=20

Here, too, the psychological effect can be calculated with pre=C2=AC=20
cision.=20

Terror at the place of employment , in the factory, in the meeting=20
hall , and on the occasion of mass demonstrations will always he suc=C2=AC=
=20
cessful unless opposed hy equal terror .=20

In this case, to be sure, the party will cry bloody murder;=20
though it has long despised all state authority, it will set up a=20
howling cry for that same authority and in most cases will=20
actually attain its goal amid the general confusion- it will find=20
some idiot of a higher official who, in the imbed! ic hope of=20
propitiating the feared adversary for later eventualities, will help=20
this world plague to break its opponent.=20

The impression made by such a success on the minds of the=20
great masses of supporters as well as opponents can only be=20
measured by those who know the soul of a people, not from=20
books, but from life. For while in the ranks of their supporters=20
the victory achieved seems a triumph of the justice of their own=20
cause, the defeated adversary in most cases despairs of the suc=C2=AC=20
cess of any further resistance.=20

The more familiar I became, principally with the methods of=20
physical terror, the more indulgent I grew toward all the hun=C2=AC=20
dreds of thousands who succumbed to it.=20

What makes me most indebted to that period of suffering is=20
that it alone gave back to me my people, taught me to distinguish=20
the victims from their seducers.=20

The results of this seduction can be designated only as victims.=20
For if I attempted to draw a few pictures from life, depicting the=20
essence of these =E2=80=98lowest=E2=80=99 classes, my picture would not be =
com=C2=AC=20
plete without the assurance that in these depths I also found=20
bright spots in the form of a rare willingness to make sacrifices.=20


Sins of the Bourgeoisie=20


45=20


of loyal comradeship, astonishing frugality, and modest reserve,=20
especially among the older workers. Even though these virtues=20
were steadily vanishing in the younger generation, if only through=20
the general effects of the big city, there were many, even among=20
the young men, whose healthy blood managed to dominate the=20
foul tricks of life. If in their political activity, these good, often=20
kind-hearted people nevertheless joined the mortal enemies of=20
our nationality, thus helping to cement their ranks, the reason=20
was that they neither understood nor could understand the base=C2=AC=20
ness of the new doctrine, and that no one else took the trouble to=20
bother about them, and finally that the social conditions were=20
stronger than any will to the contrary that may have been pres=C2=AC=20
ent. The poverty to which they sooner or later succumbed drove=20
them into the camp of the Social Democracy.=20

Since on innumerable occasions the bourgeoisie has in the clumsi=C2=AC=20
est and most immoral way opposed demands which were justified=20
from the universal human point of view , often without obtaining or=20
even justifiably expecting any profit from such an attitude, even the=20
most self-respecting worker was driven out of the trade-union or=C2=AC=20
ganization into political activity.=20

Millions of workers, I am sure, started out as enemies of the=20
Social Democratic Party in their innermost soul, but their re=C2=AC=20
sistance was overcome in a way which was sometimes utterly=20
insane; that is, when the bourgeois parties adopted a hostile at=C2=AC=20
titude toward every demand of a social character. Their simple,=20
narrow-minded rejection of all attempts to better working con=C2=AC=20
ditions, to introduce safety devices on machines, to prohibit child=20
labor and protect the woman, at least in the months when she was=20
bearing the future national comrade under her heart, contributed=20
to drive the masses into the net of Social Democracy which=20
gratefully snatched at every case of such a disgraceful attitude.=20
Never can our political bourgeoisie make good its sins in this=20
direction, for by resisting all attempts to do away with social=20
abuses, they sowed hatred and seemed to justify even the asser=C2=AC=20
tions of the mortal enemies of the entire nation, to the effect that=20
only the Social Democratic Party represented the interests of the=20
working people=20


46=20


Mein Kampf=20


Thus, to begin with, they created the moral basis for the actual=20
existence of the trade unions, the organization which has always=20
been the most effective pander to the political party.=20

In my Viennese years I was forced, whether I liked it or not, to=20
take a position on the trade unions.=20

Since I regarded them as an inseparable ingredient of the=20
Social Democratic Party as such, my decision was instantaneous=20
and =E2=80=94 mistaken.=20

I flatly rejected them without thinking.=20

And in this infinitely important question, as in so many others,=20
Fate itself became my instructor.=20

The result was a reversal of my first judgment.=20

By my twentieth year I had learned to distinguish between a=20
union as a means of defending the general social rights of the=20
wage-earner, and obtaining better living conditions for him as an=20
individual, and the trade union as an instrument of the party in=20
the political class struggle.=20

The fact that Social Democracy understood the enormous im=C2=AC=20
portance of the trade-union movement assured it of this instru=C2=AC=20
ment and hence of success; the fact that the bourgeoisie were not=20
aware of this cost them their political position. They thought=20
they could stop a logical development by means of an impertinent=20
=E2=80=98rejection/ but in reality they only forced it into illogical chan=
=C2=AC=20
nels. For to call the trade-union movement in itself unpatriotic=20
is nonsense and untrue to boot. Rather the contrary is true. If=20
trade-union activity strives and succeeds in bettering the lot of a=20
class which is one of the basic supports of the nation, its work is=20
not only not anti-patriotic or seditious, but =E2=80=98national=E2=80=99 in=
 the=20
truest sense of the word. For in this way it helps to create the=20
social premises without which a general national education is=20
unthinkable. It wins the highest merit by eliminating social=20
cankers, attacking intellectual as well as physical infections, and=20
thus helping to contribute to the general health of the body=20
politic.=20

Consequently, the question of their necessity is really super=C2=AC=20
fluous.=20


The Trade-Union Question=20


47=20


As long as there are employers with little social understanding=20
or a deficient sense of justice and propriety, it is not only the=20
right but the duty of their employees, who certainly constitute a=20
part of our nationality, to protect the interests of the general=20
public against the greed and unreason of the individual; for the=20
preservation of loyalty and faith in a social group is just as much=20
to the interest of a nation as the preservation of the people=E2=80=99s=20
health.=20

Both of these are seriously menaced by unworthy employers=20
who do not feel themselves to be members of the national com=C2=AC=20
munity as a whole. From the disastrous effects of their greed or=20
ruthlessness grow profound evils for the future.=20

To eliminate the causes of such a development is to do a service=20
to the nation and in no sense the opposite.=20

Let no one say that every individual is free to draw the conse*=20
quences from an actual or supposed injustice; in other words, to=20
leave his job. No! This is shadow-boxing and must be regarded as=20
an attempt to divert attention. Either the elimination of bad,=20
unsocial conditions serves the interest of the nation or it does not.=20
If it does, the struggle against them must be carried on with=20
weapons which offer the hope of success. The individual worker,=20
however, is never in a position to defend himself against the=20
power of the great industrialist, for in such matters it cannot be=20
superior justice that conquers (if that were recognized, the whole=20
struggle would stop from lack of cause) =E2=80=94 no, what matters here is=
=20
superior power. Otherwise the sense of justice alone would bring=20
the struggle to a fair conclusion, or, more accurately speaking,=20
the struggle could never arise.=20

No, if the unsocial or unworthy treatment of men calls for resist=C2=AC=20
ance, this struggle, as long as no legal judicial authorities have been=20
created for the elimination of these evils, can only be decided by=20
superior power. And this makes it obvious that the power of the=20
employer concentrated in a single person can only be countered by=20
the mass of employees banded imo a single person, if the possibility=20
of a victory is not to be renounced in advance.=20

Thus, trade-union organization can lead to a strengthening of=20


48=20


Mein Kampf=20


the social idea in its practical effects on daily life, and thereby to=20
an elimination of irritants which are constantly giving cause for=20
dissatisfaction and complaints.=20

If this is not the case, it is to a great extent the fault of those=20
who have been able to place obstacles in the path of any legal=20
regulation of social evils or thwart them by means of their politi=C2=AC=20
cal influence.=20

Proportionately as the political bourgeoisie did not understand,=20
or rather did not want to understand, the importance of trade-=20
union organization, and resisted it, the Social Democrats took=20
possession of the contested movement. Thus, far-sightedly it=20
created a firm foundation which on several critical occasions has=20
stood up when all other supports failed. In this way the intrinsic=20
purpose was gradually submerged, making place for new aims.=20

It never occurred to the Social Democrats to limit the move=C2=AC=20
ment they had thus captured to its original task.=20

No, that was far from their intention.=20

In a few decades the weapon for defending the social rights of=20
man had, in their experienced hands, become an instrument for=20
the destruction of the national economy. And they did not let=20
themselves be hindered in the least by the interests of the workers.=20
For in politics, as in other fields, the use of economic pressure=20
always permits blackmail, as long as the necessary unscrupulous=C2=AC=20
ness is present on the one side, and sufficient sheeplike patience=20
on the other.=20

Something which in this case was true of both sides.=20

# # #=20

By the turn of the century, the trade-union movement had=20
ceased to serve its former function. From year to year it had=20
entered more and more into the sphere of Social Democratic=20
politics and finally had no use except as a battering-ram in the=20
class struggle. Its purpose was to cause the collapse of the whole=20
arduously constructed economic edifice by persistent blows, thus,=20


POLITIZATION OF TRADE UNIONS=20


49=20


the more easily, after removing its economic foundations, to pre=C2=AC=20
pare the same lot for the edifice of state. Less and less attention=20
was paid to defending the real needs of the working class, and=20
finally political expediency made it seem undesirable to relieve=20
the social or cultural miseries of the broad masses at all, for other=C2=AC=
=20
wise there was a risk that these masses, satisfied in their desires,=20
could no longer be used forever as docile shock troops.=20

The leaders of the class struggle looked on this development=20
with such dark foreboding and dread that in the end they re=C2=AC=20
jected any really beneficial social betterment out of hand, and=20
actually attacked it with the greatest determination.=20

And they were never at a loss for an explanation of a line of=20
behavior which seemed so inexplicable.=20

By screwing the demands higher and higher, they made their=20
possible fulfillment seem so trivial and unimportant that they=20
were able at all times to tell the masses that they were dealing=20
with nothing but a diabolical attempt to weaken, if possible in=20
fact to paralyze, the offensive power of the working class in the=20
cheapest way, by such a ridiculous satisfaction of the most ele=C2=AC=20
mentary rights. In view of the great masses=E2=80=99 small capacity for=20
thought, we need not be surprised at the success of these=20
methods.=20

The bourgeois camp was indignant at this obvious insincerity=20
of Social Democratic tactics, but did not draw from it the slight=C2=AC=20
est inference with regard to their own conduct. The Social=20
Democrats=E2=80=99 fear of really raising the working class out of the=20
depths of their cultural and social misery should have inspired=20
the greatest exertions in this very direction, thus gradually=20
wresting the weapon from the hands of the advocates of the=20
class struggle.=20

This, however, was not done.=20

Instead of attacking and seizing the enemy=E2=80=99s position, the=20
bourgeoisie preferred to let themselves be pressed to the wall and=20
finally had recourse to utterly inadequate makeshifts, which re=C2=AC=20
mained ineffectual because they came too late, and, moreover,=20
were easy to reject because they were too insignificant. Thus,=20


50=20


Mein Kampf=20


in reality, everything remained as before, except that the dis=C2=AC=20
content was greater.=20

Like a menacing storm-cloud, the =E2=80=98free trade union=E2=80=99 hung, e=

then, over the political horizon and the existence of the individual.=20

It was one of the most frightful instruments of terror against=20
the security and independence of the national economy, the=20
solidity of the state, and personal freedom.=20

And chiefly this was what made the concept of democracy a=20
sordid and ridiculous phrase, and held up brotherhood to ever=C2=AC=20
lasting scorn in the words: =E2=80=98And if our comrade you won=E2=80=99t b=

we=E2=80=99ll bash your head in =E2=80=94 one, two, three!=E2=80=99=20

And that was how I became acquainted with this friend of=20
humanity. In the course of the years my view was broadened=20
and deepened, but I have had no need to change it.=20

The greater insight I gathered into the external character of=20
Social Democracy, the greater became my longing to comprehend=20
the inner core of this doctrine.=20

The official party literature was not much use for this purpose.=20
In so far as it deals with economic questions, its assertions and=20
proofs are false; in so far as it treats of political aims, it lies.=20
Moreover, I was inwardly repelled by the new-fangled petti=C2=AC=20
fogging phraseology and the style in which it was written. With=20
an enormous expenditure of words, unclear in content or incom=C2=AC=20
prehensible as to meaning, they stammer an endless hodgepodge=20
of phrases purportedly as witty as in reality they are meaningless.=20
Only our decadent metropolitan bohemians can feel at home in=20
this maze of reasoning and cull an =E2=80=98inner experience=E2=80=99 from =
this=20
dung-heap of literary dadaism, supported by the proverbial=20
modesty of a section of our people who always detect profound=20
wisdom in what is most incomprehensible to them personally.=20
However, by balancing the theoretical untruth and nonsense of=20
this doctrine with the reality of the phenomenon, I gradually=20
obtained a clear picture of its intrinsic will.=20


The Jewish Question=20


5L=20


At such times I was overcome by gloomy foreboding and=20
malignant fear. Then I saw before me a doctrine, comprised of=20
egotism and hate, which can lead to victory pursuant to mathe=C2=AC=20
matical laws, but in so doing must put an end to humanity.=20

Meanwhile, I had learned to understand the connection be=C2=AC=20
tween this doctrine of destruction and the nature of a people of=20
which, up to that time, I had known next to nothing.=20

Only a knowledge of the Jews provides the key with which to com=C2=AC=20
prehend the inner, and consequently real , aims of Social Democracy,=20
The erroneous conceptions of the aim and meaning of this party=20
fall from our eyes like veils, once we come to know this people,=20
and from the fog and mist of social phrases rises the leering=20
grimace of Marxism.=20


* # #=20


Today it is difficult, if not impossible, for me to say when the=20
word * Jew=E2=80=99 first gave me ground for special thoughts. At home I=20
do not remember having heard the word during my father=E2=80=99s life=C2=AC=
=20
time. I believe that the old gentleman would have regarded any=20
special emphasis on this term as cultural backwardness. In the=20
course of his life he had arrived at more or less cosmopolitan=20
views which, despite his pronounced national sentiments, not=20
only remained intact, but also affected me to some extent.=20

Likewise at school I found no occasion which could have led=20
me to change this inherited picture.=20

At the Realschule, to be sure, I did meet one Jewish boy who=20
was treated by all of us with caution, but only because various=20
experiences had led us to doubt his discretion and we did not=20
particularly trust him; but neither I nor the others had any=20
thoughts on the matter.=20

Not until my fourteenth or fifteenth year did I begin to come=20
across the word =E2=80=98 Jew/ with any frequency, partly in connection=20
with political discussions. This filled me with a mild distaste, and=20
I could not rid myself of an unpleasant feeling that always came=20


52=20


Mein Kampf=20


over me whenever religious quarrels occurred in my presence.=20

At that time I did not think anything else of the question.=20

There were few Jews in Linz. In the course of the centuries=20
their outward appearance had become Europeanized and had=20
taken on a human look; in fact, I even took them for Germans.=20
The absurdity of this idea did not dawn on me because I saw no=20
distinguishing feature but the strange religion. The fact that=20
they had, as I believed, been persecuted on this account some=C2=AC=20
times almost turned my distaste at unfavorable remarks about=20
them into horror.=20

Thus far I did not so much as suspect the existence of an or=C2=AC=20
ganized opposition to the Jews.=20

Then I came to Vienna.=20

Preoccupied by the abundance of my impressions in the archi=C2=AC=20
tectural field, oppressed by the hardship of my own lot, I gained=20
at first no insight into the inner stratification of the people in this=20
gigantic city. Notwithstanding that Vienna in those days=20
counted nearly two hundred thousand Jews among its two million=20
inhabitants, I did not see them. In the first few weeks my eyes=20
and my senses were not equal to the flood of values and ideas.=20
Not until calm gradually returned and the agitated picture began=20
to clear did I look around me more carefully in my new world,=20
and then among other things I encountered the Jewish question.=20

I cannot maintain that the way in which I became acquainted=20
with them struck me as particularly pleasant. For the Jew was=20
still characterized for me by nothing but his religion, and there=C2=AC=20
fore, on grounds of human tolerance, I maintained my rejection=20
of religious attacks in this case as in others. Consequently, the=20
tone, particularly that of the Viennese anti-Semitic press, seemed=20
to me unworthy of the cultural tradition of a great nation. I was=20
oppressed by the memory of certain occurrences in the Middle=20
Ages, which I should not have liked to see repeated. Since the=20
newspapers in question did not enjoy an outstanding reputation=20
(the reason for this, at that time, I myself did not precisely know),=20
I regarded them more as the products of anger and envy than the=20
results of a principled, though perhaps mistaken, point of view.=20


The So-Called World Press=20


53=20


I was reinforced in this opinion by what seemed to me the far=20
more dignified form in wdiich the really big papers answered all=20
these attacks, or, what seemed to me even more praiseworthy,=20
failed to mention them; in other words, simply killed them with=20
silence.=20

I zealously read the so-called world press (Neue Freie Presse y=20
Wiener Tageblatt, etc.) and was amazed at the scope of what they=20
offered their readers and the objectivity of individual articles. 1=20
respected the exalted tone, though the flamboyance of the style=20
sometimes caused me inner dissatisfaction, or even struck me=20
unpleasantly. Yet this may have been due to the rhythm of life=20
in the whole metropolis.=20

Since in those days I saw Vienna in that light, I thought my=C2=AC=20
self justified in accepting this explanation of mine as a valid ex=C2=AC=20
cuse.=20

But what sometimes repelled me was the undignified fashion in=20
which this press curried favor with the Court. There was scarcely=20
an event in the Hofburg which was not imparted to the readers=20
either with raptures of enthusiasm or plaintive emotion, and all=20
this to-do, particularly when it dealt with the 1 wisest monarch 3=20
of all time, almost reminded me of the mating cry of a mountain=20
cock.=20

To me the whole thing seemed artificial.=20

In my eyes it was a blemish upon liberal democracy.=20

To curry favor with this Court and in such indecent forms was=20
to sacrifice the dignity of the nation.=20

This was the first shadow to darken my intellectual relationship=20
with the =E2=80=98 big =E2=80=99 Viennese press.=20

As I had always done before, I continued in Vienna to follow=20
events in Germany with ardent zeal, quite regardless whether=20
they were political or cultural. With pride and admiration, I=20
compared the rise of the Reich with the wasting away of the=20
Austrian state. If events in the field of foreign politics filled me,=20
by and large, with undivided joy, the less gratifying aspects of=20
internal life often aroused anxiety and gloom. The struggle=20
which at that time was being carried on against William II did=20


54=20


Mein Kampf=20


not meet with my approval. I regarded him not only as the=20
German Emperor, but first and foremost as the creator of a=20
German fleet. The restrictions of speech imposed on the Kaiser=20
by the Reichstag angered me greatly because they emanated=20
from a source which in my opinion really hadn=E2=80=99t a leg to stand on,=
=20
since in a single session these parliamentarian imbeciles gabbled=20
more nonsense than a whole dynasty of emperors, including its=20
very weakest numbers, could ever have done in centuries.=20

I was outraged that in a state where every idiot not only=20
claimed the right to criticize, but was given a seat in the Reichstag=20
and let loose upon the nation as a =E2=80=98lawgiver,=E2=80=99 the man who =
bore=20
the imperial crown had to take =E2=80=98reprimands=E2=80=99 from the greate=
st=20
babblers=E2=80=99 club of all time.=20

But I was even more indignant that the same Viennese press=20
which made the most obsequious bows to every rickety horse in=20
the Court, and flew into convulsions of joy if he accidentally=20
swished his tail, should, with supposed concern, yet, as it seemed=20
to me, ill-concealed majice, express its criticisms of the German=20
Kaiser. Of course it had no intention of interfering with condi=C2=AC=20
tions within the German Reich =E2=80=94 oh, no, God forbid =E2=80=94 but by=
=20
placing its finger, on these wounds in the friendliest way, it was=20
fulfilling the duty imposed by the spirit of the mutual alliance,=20
and, conversely, fulfilling the requirements of journalistic truth,=20
etc. And now it was poking *his finger around in the wound to=20
its heart=E2=80=99s content.=20

In such cases the blood rose to my head.=20

It was this which caused me little by little to view the big=20
papers with greater caution.=20

And on one such occasion I was forced to recognize that one of=20
the anti-Semitic papers, the Deutsches Volksblatt, behaved more=20
decently.=20

Another thing that got on my nerves was the loathsome cult=20
for France which the big press, even then, carried on. A man=20
couldn=E2=80=99t help feeling ashamed to be a German when he saw these=20
saccharine hymns of praise to the =E2=80=98great cultural nation.=E2=80=99 =
This=20
wretched licking of France=E2=80=99s boots more than once made me=20


Transformation into an Anti-Semite=20


55=20


throw down one of these =E2=80=98 world newspapers/ And on such oc=C2=AC=20
casions I sometimes picked up the Volksblatt , which, to be sure,=20
seemed to me much smaller, but in these matters somewhat=20
more appetizing. I was not in agreement with the sharp anti-=20
Semitic tone, but from time to time I read arguments which gave=20
me some food for thought.=20

At all events, these occasions slowly made me acquainted with=20
the man and the movement, which in those days guided Vienna=E2=80=99s=20
destinies: Dr. Karl Lueger 1 and the Christian Social Party.=20

When I arrived in Vienna, I was hostile to both of them.=20

The man and the movement seemed =E2=80=98 reactionary =E2=80=99 in my eyes.=
=20

My common sense of justice, however, forced me to change this=20
judgment in proportion as I had occasion to become acquainted=20
with the man and his work; and slowly my fair judgment turned=20
to unconcealed admiration. Today, more than ever, I regard this=20
man as the greatest German mayor of all times.=20

How many of my basic principles were upset by this change=20
in my attitude toward the Christian Social movement!=20

My views with regard to anti-Semitism thus succumbed to the=20
passage of time, and this was my greatest transformation of all.=20

It cost me the greatest inner soul struggles, and only after=20
months of battle between my reason and my sentiments did my=20
reason begin to emerge victorious. Two years later, my senti=C2=AC=20
ment had followed my reason, and from then on became its most=20
loyal guardian and sentinel.=20

At the time of this bitter struggle between spiritual education=20
and cold reason, the visual instruction of the Vienna streets=20
had performed invaluable services. There came a time when I no=20
longer, as in the first days, wandered blindly through the mighty=20
city; now with open eyes I saw not only the buildings but also=20
the people.=20

1 Karl Lueger (1844-1910). In 1897, as a member of the anti-Semitic=20
Christian Social Party, he became mayor of Vienna and kept the post until=
=20
his death. At first opposed by the Court for his radical nationalism and=20
anti-Semitism, toward the end of his career he became more moderate and=20
was reconciled with the Emperor.=20


56=20


Mein Kampf=20


Once, as I was strolling through the Inner City, I suddenly=20
encountered an apparition in a black caftan and black hair locks.=20
Is this a Jew? was my first thought.=20

For, to be sure, they had not looked like that in Linz. I ob=C2=AC=20
served the man furtively and cautiously, but the longer I stared=20
at this foreign face, scrutinizing feature for feature, the more my=20
first question assumed a new form:=20

Is this a German?=20

As always in such cases, I now began to try to relieve my=20
doubts by books. For a few hellers I bought the first anti-Semitic=20
pamphlets of my life. Unfortunately, they all proceeded from=20
the supposition that in principle the reader knew or even under=C2=AC=20
stood the Jewish question to a certain degree. Besides, the tone=20
for the most part was such that doubts again, arose in me, due in=20
part to the dull and amazingly unscientific arguments favoring=20
the thesis.=20

I relapsed for weeks at a time, once even for months.=20

The whole thing seemed to me so monstrous, the accusations=20
so boundless, that, tormented by the fear of doing injustice, I=20
again became anxious and uncertain.=20

Yet I could no longer very well doubt that the objects of my=20
study were not Germans of a special religion, but a people in them=C2=AC=20
selves; for since I had begun to concern myself with this question=20
and to take cognizance of the Jews, Vienna appeared to me in a=20
different light than before. Wherever I went, I began to see Jews,=20
and the more I saw, the more sharply they became distinguished=20
in my eyes from the rest of humanity. Particularly the Inner=20
City and the districts north of the Danube Canal swarmed=20
with a people which even outwardly had lost all resemblance to=20
Germans.=20

And whatever doubts I may still have nourished were finally=20
dispelled by the attitude of a portion of the Jews themselves.=20

Among them there was a great movement, quite extensive in=20
Vienna, which came out sharply in confirmation of the national=20
character of the Jews: this was the Zionists.=20

It looked, to be sure, as though only a part of the Jews ap-=20


Transformation into an Anti-Semite=20


57=20


proved this viewpoint, while the great majority condemned and=20
inwardly rejected such a formulation. But when examined more=20
closely, this appearance dissolved itself into an unsavory vapor=20
of pretexts advanced for mere reasons of expedience, not to say=20
lies. For the so-called liberal Jews did not reject the Zionists as=20
non-Jews, but only as Jews with an impractical, perhaps even=20
dangerous, way of publicly avowing their Jewishness.=20

Intrinsically they remained unalterably of one piece.=20

In a short time this apparent struggle between Zionistic and=20
liberal Jews disgusted me; for it was false through and through,=20
founded on lies and scarcely in keeping with the moral elevation=20
and purity always claimed by this people.=20

The cleanliness of this people, moral and otherwise, I must say,=20
is a point in itself. By their very exterior you could tell that these=20
were no lovers of water, and, to your distress, you often knew it=20
with your eyes closed. Later I often grew sick to my stomach=20
from the smell of these caftan-wearers. Added to this, there was=20
their unclean dress and their generally unheroic appearance.=20

All this could scarcely be called very attractive; but it became=20
positively repulsive when, in addition to their physical uncleanli=C2=AC=20
ness, you discovered the moral stains on this =E2=80=98chosen people.=E2=80=
=99=20

In a short time I was made more thoughtful than ever by my=20
slowly rising insight into the type of activity carried on by the=20
Jews in certain fields.=20

Was there any form of filth or profligacy, particularly in cultu=C2=AC=20
ral life, without at least one Jew involved in it?=20

If you cut even cautiously into such an abscess, you found, like=20
a maggot in a rotting body, often dazzled by the sudden light =E2=80=94=20
a kike! 1=20

What had to be reckoned heavily against the Jews in my eyes=20
was when I became acquainted with their activity in the press,=20
art, literature, and the theater. All the unctuous reassurances=20
helped little or nothing. It sufficed to look at a billboard, to study=20

the names of the men behind the horrible trash they advertised,=20
to make you hard for a long time to come. This was pestilence,=20
spiritual pestilence, worse than the Black Death of olden times,=20
and the people was being infected with it! It goes without saying=20
that the lower the intellectual level of one of these art manu=C2=AC=20
facturers, the more unlimited his fertility will be, and the=20
scoundrel ends up like a garbage separator, splashing his filth in=20
the face of humanity. And bear in mind that there is no limit to=20
their number; bear in mind that for one Goethe Nature easily=20
can foist on the world ten thousand of these scribblers who poison=20
men=E2=80=99s souls like germ-carriers of the worse sort, on their fellow=
=20
men.=20

It was terrible, but not to be overlooked, that precisely the=20
Jew, in tremendous numbers, seemed chosen by Nature for this=20
shameful calling.=20

Is this why the Jews are called the =E2=80=98chosen people=E2=80=99?=20

I now began to examine carefully the names of all the creators=20
of unclean products in public artistic life. The result was less and=20
less favorable for my previous attitude toward the Jews. Regard=C2=AC=20
less how my sentiment might resist, my reason was forced to draw=20
its conclusions.=20

The fact that nine tenths of all literary filth, artistic trash, and=20
theatrical idiocy can be set to the account of a people, constituting=20
hardly one hundredth of all the country=E2=80=99s inhabitants, could=20
simply not be talked away; it was the plain truth.=20

And I now began to examine my beloved =E2=80=98world press=E2=80=99 from=20
this point of view.=20

And the deeper I probed, the more the object of my former=20
admiration shriveled. The style became more and more unbear=C2=AC=20
able; I could not help rejecting the content as inwardly shallow=20
and banal; the objectivity of exposition now seemed to me more=20
akin to lies than honest truth; and the writers were =E2=80=94 Jews.=20

A thousand things which I had hardly seen before now struck=20
my notice, and others, which had previously given me food for=20
thought, I now learned to grasp and understand.=20

I now saw the liberal attitude of this press in a different light;=20


Transformation into an Anti-Semite=20


59=20


the lofty tone in which it answered attacks and its method of=20
killing them with silence now revealed itself to me as a trick as=20
clever as it was treacherous; the transfigured raptures of their=20
theatrical critics were always directed at Jewish writers, and their=20
disapproval never struck anyone but Germans. The gentle pin=C2=AC=20
pricks against William II revealed its methods by their persist=C2=AC=20
ency, and so did its commendation of French culture and civiliza=C2=AC=20
tion. The trashy content of the short story now appeared to me=20
as outright indecency, and in the language I detected the accents=20
of a foreign people; the sense of the whole thing was so obviously=20
hostile to Germanism that this could only have been intentional.=20

But who had an interest in this?=20

Was all this a mere accident?=20

Gradually I became uncertain.=20

The development was accelerated by insights which I gained=20
into a number of other matters. I am referring to the general view of=20
ethics and morals which was quite openly exhibited by a large part=20
of the Jews, and the practical application of which could be seen.=20

Here again the streets provided an object lesson of a sort=20
which was sometimes positively evil.=20

The relation of the Jews to prostitution and, even more, to the=20
white-slave traffic, could be studied in Vienna as perhaps in no=20
other city of Western Europe, with the possible exception of the=20
southern French ports. If you walked at night through the streets=20
and alleys of Leopoldstadt, 1 at every step you witnessed pro=C2=AC=20
ceedings which remained concealed from the majority of the=20
German people until the War gave the soldiers on the eastern=20
front occasion to see similar things, or, better expressed, forced=20
them to see them.=20

When thus for the first time I recognized the Jew as the cold-=20
hearted, shameless, and calculating director of this revolting vice=20
traffic in the scum of the big city, a cold shudder ran down my=20
back.=20

Mein Kampf=20


But then a flame flared up within me. I no longer avoided dis=C2=AC=20
cussion of the Jewish question; no, now I sought it. And when I=20
learned to look for the Jew in all branches of cultural and artistic=20
life and its various manifestations, I suddenly encountered him=20
in a place where I would least have expected to find him.=20

When I recognized the Jew as the leader of the Social Democ=C2=AC=20
racy, the scales dropped from my eyes. A long soul struggle had=20
reached its conclusion.=20

Even in my daily relations with my fellow workers, I ob=C2=AC=20
served the amazing adaptability with which they adopted dif=C2=AC=20
ferent positions on the same question, sometimes within an in=C2=AC=20
terval of a few days, sometimes in only a few hours. It was hard=20
for me to understand how people who, when spoken to alone,=20
possessed some sensible opinions, suddenly lost them as soon as=20
they came under the influence of the masses. It was often enough=20
to make one despair. When, after hours of argument, I was con=C2=AC=20
vinced that now at last I had broken the ice or cleared up some=20
absurdity, and was beginning to rejoice at my success, on the next=20
day to my disgust I had to begin all over again; it had all been in=20
vain. Like an eternal pendulum their opinions seemed to swing=20
back again and again to the old madness.=20

All this I could understand: that they were dissatisfied with=20
their lot and cursed the Fate which often struck them so harshly;=20
that they hated the employers who seemed to them the heartless=20
bailiffs of Fate; that they cursed the authorities who in their eyes=20
were without feeling for their situation; that they demonstrated=20
against food^ prices and carried their demands into the streets:=20
this much could be understood without recourse to reason. But=20
what inevitably remained incomprehensible was the boundless=20
hatred they heaped upon their own nationality, despising its=20
greatness, besmirching its history, and dragging its great men=20
into the gutter.=20

This struggle against their own species, their own clan, their=20
own homeland, was as senseless as it was incomprehensible. It=20
was unnatural.=20

It was possible to cure them temporarily of this vice, but only=20


The Jew as Leader of Social Democracy 61=20

for days or at most weeks. If later you met the man you thought=20
you had converted, he was just the same as before.=20

His old unnatural state had regained full possession of him.=20

# # #=20

I gradually became aware that the Social Democratic press was=20
directed predominantly by Jews; yet I did not attribute any=20
special significance to this circumstance, since conditions were=20
exactly the same in the other papers. Yet one fact seemed con=C2=AC=20
spicuous: there was not one paper with Jews working on it which=20
could have been regarded as truly national, according to my educa=C2=AC=20
tion and way of thinking.=20

I swallowed my disgust and tried to read this type of Marxist=20
press production, but my revulsion became so unlimited in so=20
doing that I endeavored to become more closely acquainted with=20
the men who manufactured these compendiums of knavery.=20

From the publisher down, they were all Jews.=20

I took all the Social Democratic pamphlets I could lay hands=20
on and sought the names of their authors: Jews. I noted the=20
names of the leaders; by far the greatest part were likewise mem=C2=AC=20
bers of the =E2=80=98chosen people/ whether they were representatives=20
in the Reichsrat or trade-union secretaries, the heads of organiza=C2=AC=20
tions or street agitators. It was always the same gruesome pic=C2=AC=20
ture. The names of the Austerlitzes, Davids, Adlers, Ellenbogens,=20
etc., will remain forever graven in my memory. One thing had=20
grown clear to me: the party with whose petty representatives I=20
had been carrying on the most violent struggle for months was, as=20
to leadership, almost exclusively in the hands of a foreign people;=20
for, to my deep and joyful satisfaction, I had at last come to the=20
conclusion that the Jew was no German.=20

Only now did I become thoroughly acquainted with the se=C2=AC=20
ducer of our people.=20

A single year of my sojourn in Vienna had sufficed to imbue=20
me with the conviction that no worker could be so stubborn that=20


62=20


j=20


Mein Kampe=20


he would not in the end succumb to better knowledge and better=20
explanations. Slowly I had become an expert in their own doc=C2=AC=20
trine and used it as a weapon in the struggle for my own profound=20
conviction.=20

Success almost always favored my side.=20

The great masses could be saved, if only with the gravest=20
sacrifice in time and patience.=20

But a Jew could never be parted from his opinions.=20

At that time I was still childish enough to try to make the=20
madness of their doctrine clear to them; in my little circle I talked=20
my tongue sore and my throat hoarse, thinking I would in=C2=AC=20
evitably succeed in convincing them how ruinous their Marxist=20
madness was; but what I accomplished was often the opposite.=20
It seemed as though their increased understanding of the destruc=C2=AC=20
tive effects of Social Democratic theories and their results only=20
reinforced their determination.=20

The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their=20
dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary,=20
and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves=20
simply played stupid. If all this didn't help, they pretended not=20
to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a=20
hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they im=C2=AC=20
mediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again=20
attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what=20
you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of=20
these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which=20
divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next=20
moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these=20
fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he=20
couldn't help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken=20
you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the=20
next day. The Jew had not the slightest recollection of the day=20
before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at=20
all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amaze=C2=AC=20
ment; he couldn't remember a thing, except that he had proved=20
the correctness of his assertions the previous day.=20

Sometimes I stood there thunderstruck.=20

I didn=E2=80=99t know what to be more amazed at: the agility of their=20
tongues or their virtuosity at lying.=20

Gradually I began to hate them.=20

All this had but one good side: that in proportion as the real=20
leaders or at least the disseminators of Social Democracy came=20
within my vision, my love for my people inevitably grew. For=20
who, in view of the diabolical craftiness of these seducers, could=20
damn the luckless victims? How hard it was, even for me, to get=20
the better of this race of dialectical liars! And how futile was such=20
success in dealing with people who twist the truth in your mouth,=20
who without so much as a blush disavow the word they have just=20
spoken, and in the very next minute take credit for it after=20
ail.=20

No. The better acquainted I became with the Jew, the more=20
forgiving I inevitably became toward the worker.=20

In my eyes the gravest fault was no longer with him, but with=20
all those who did not regard it as worth the trouble to have mercy=20
on him, with iron righteousness giving the son of the people his=20
just, deserts, and standing the seducer and corrupter up against=20
the wall.=20

Inspired by the experience of daily life, I now began to track=20
down the sources of the Marxist doctrine. Its effects had become=20
clear to me in individual cases; each day its success was apparent=20
to my attentive eyes, and, with some exercise of my imagination,=20
I was able to picture the consequences. The only remaining=20
question was whether the result of their action in its ultimate=20
form had existed in the mind=E2=80=99s eye of the creators, or whether=20
they themselves were the victims of an error.=20

I felt that both were possible.=20

In the one case it was the duty of every thinking man to force=20
himself to the forefront of the ill-starred movement, thus perhaps=20
averting catastrophe; in the other, however, the original founders=20
of this plague of the nations must have been veritable devils; for=20
only in the brain of a monster =E2=80=94 not that of a man =E2=80=94 could =
the=20
plan of an organization assume form and meaning, whose activity=20


64=20


Mein Kampf=20


must ultimately result in the collapse of human civilization and=20
the consequent devastation of the world.=20

In this case the only remaining hope was struggle, struggle=20
with all the weapons which the human spirit, reason, and will=20
can devise, regardless on which side of the scale Fate should lay=20
its blessing.=20

Thus I began to make myself familiar with the founders of this=20
doctrine, in order to study the foundations of the movement. If=20
I reached my goal more quickly than at first I had perhaps ven=C2=AC=20
tured to believe, it was thanks to my newly acquired, though at=20
that time not very profound, knowledge of the Jewish question.=20
This alone enabled me to draw a practical comparison between=20
the reality and the theoretical flim-flam of the founding fathers=20
of Social Democracy, since it taught me to understand the lan=C2=AC=20
guage of the Jewish people, who speak in order to conceal or at=20
least to veil their thoughts; their real aim is not therefore to be=20
found in the lines themselves, but slumbers well concealed be=C2=AC=20
tween them.=20

For me this was the time of the greatest spiritual upheaval I=20
have ever had to go through.=20

I had ceased to be a weak-kneed cosmopolitan and become an=20
anti-Semite.=20

Just once more =E2=80=94 and this was the last time =E2=80=94 fearful, op=
=C2=AC=20
pressive thoughts came to me in profound anguish.=20

When over long periods of human history I scrutinized the=20
activity of the Jewish people, suddenly there rose up in me the=20
fearful question whether inscrutable Destiny, perhaps for reasons=20
unknown to us poor mortals, did not with eternal and immutable=20
resolve, desire the final victory of this little nation.=20

Was it possible that the earth had been promised as a reward=20
to this people which lives only for this earth?=20

Have we an objective right to struggle for our self-preservation,=20
or is this justified only subjectively within ourselves?=20

As I delved more deeply into the teachings of Marxism and=20
thus in tranquil clarity submitted the deeds of the Jewish people=20
to contemplation, Fate itself gave me its answer.=20


Marxism as the Destroyer of Culture=20


65=20


The Jewish doctrine of Marxism rejects the aristocratic princi=C2=AC=20
ple of Nature and replaces the eternal privilege of power and=20
strength by the mass of numbers and their dead weight. Thus it=20
denies the value of personality in man, contests the significance=20
of nationality and race, and thereby withdraws from humanity=20
the premise of its existence and its culture. As a foundation of=20
the universe, this doctrine would bring about the end of any=20
order intellectually conceivable to man. And as, in this greatest=20
of all recognizable organisms, the result of an application of such=20
a law could only be chaos, on earth it could only be destruction=20
for the inhabitants of this planet.=20

If, with the help of his Marxist creed, the Jew is victorious over=20
the other peoples of the world, his crown will be the funeral wreath=20
of humanity and this planet will, as it did thousands 1 of years=20
ago, move through the ether devoid of men.=20

Eternal Nature inexorably avenges the infringement of her=20
commands.=20

Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the=20
will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew t=20
I am fighting for the work of the Lord.=20

General Political Considerations Based on=20
My Vienna Period=20


'T=20

i oday it is my conviction that in general,=20
aside from cases of unusual talent, a man should not engage in=20
public political activity before his thirtieth year. He- should not=20
do so, because up to this time, as a rule, he is engaged in molding=20
a general platform, on the basis of which he proceeds to examine=20
the various political problems and finally establishes his own posi=C2=AC=
=20
tion on them. Only after he has acquired such a basic philosophy,=20
and the resultant firmness of outlook on the special problems of=20
the day, is he, inwardly at least, mature enough to be justified in=20
partaking in the political leadership of the general public.=20

Otherwise he runs the risk of either having to change his former=20
position on essential questions, or, contrary to his better know=C2=AC=20
ledge and understanding, of clinging to a view which reason and=20
conviction have long since discarded. In the former case this is=20
most embarrassing to him personally, since, what with his own=20
vacillations, he cannot justifiably expect the faith of his adher=C2=AC=20
ents to follow him with the same unswerving firmness as before;=20
for those led by him, on the other hand, such a reversal on the=20
part of the leader means perplexity and not rarely a certain feel=C2=AC=20
ing of shame toward those whom they hitherto opposed. In the=20
second case, there occurs a thing which, particularly today, often=20
confronts us: in the same measure as the leader ceases to believe=20
in what he says, his arguments become shallow and flat, but he=20
tries to make up for it by vileness in his choice of means. While=20


The Politician=20


67=20


he himself has given up all idea of fighting seriously for his politi=C2=AC=
=20
cal revelations (a man does not die for something which he him=C2=AC=20
self does not believe in), his demands on his supporters become=20
correspondingly greater and more shameless until he ends up by=20
sacrificing the last shred of leadership and turning into a =E2=80=98politi=
=C2=AC=20
cian=E2=80=99; in other words, the kind of man whose only real conviction=
=20
is lack of conviction, combined with offensive impertinence and=20
an art of lying, often developed to the point of complete shame=C2=AC=20
lessness.=20

If to the misfortune of decent people such a character gets into=20
a parliament, we may as well realize at once that the essence of=20
his politics will from now on consist in nothing but an heroic=20
struggle for the permanent possession of his feeding-bottle for=20
himself and his family. The more his wife and children depend=20
on it, the more tenaciously he will fight for his mandate. This=20
alone will make every other man with political instincts his per=C2=AC=20
sonal enemy; in every new movement he will scent the possible=20
beginning of his end, and in every man of any greatness the dan=C2=AC=20
ger which menaces him through that man.=20

I shall have more to say about this type of parliamentary bed=C2=AC=20
bug.=20

Even a man of thirty will have much to learn in the course of=20
his life, but this will only be to supplement and fill in the frame=C2=AC=
=20
work provided him by the philosophy he has basically adopted.=20
When he learns, his learning will not have to be a revision of=20
principle, but a supplementary study, and his supporters will not=20
have to choke down the oppressive feeling that they have hitherto=20
been falsely instructed by him. On the contrary: the visible,=20
organic growth of the leader will give them satisfaction, for when=20
he learns, he will only be deepening their own philosophy. And=20
this in their eyes will be a proof for the correctness of the views=20
they have hitherto held.=20

A leader who must depart from the platform of his general=20
philosophy as such, because he recognizes it to be false, behaves=20
with decency only if, in recognizing the error of his previous in=C2=AC=20
sight, he is prepared to draw the ultimate consequence. In such=20


68=20


Mein Kampi=20


a case he must, at the very least, renounce the public exercise of=20
any further political activity. For since in matters of basic know=C2=AC=20
ledge he has once succumbed to an error, there is a possibility=20
that this will happen a second time. And in no event does he re=C2=AC=20
tain the right to continue claiming, not to mention demanding,=20
the confidence of his fellow citizens.=20

How little regard is taken of such decency today is attested by=20
the general degeneracy of the rabble which contemporaneously=20
feel justified in =E2=80=98going into=E2=80=99 politics.=20

Hardly a one of them is fit for it.=20

I had carefully avoided any public appearance, though I think=20
that I studied politics more closely than many other men. Only=20
in the smallest groups did I speak of the things which inwardly=20
moved or attracted me. This speaking in the narrowest circles=20
had many good points: I learned to orate less, but to know people=20
with their opinions and objections that were often so boundlessly=20
primitive. And I trained myself, without losing the time and=20
occasion for the continuance of my own education. It is certain=20
that nowhere else in Germany was the opportunity for this so=20
favorable as in Vienna.=20

General political thinking in the old Danubian monarchy w r as=20
just then broader and more comprehensive in scope than in old=20
Germany, excluding parts of Prussia, Hamburg, and the North=20
Sea coast, at the same period. In this case, to be sure, I under=C2=AC=20
stand, under the designation of =E2=80=98Austria/ that section of the=20
great Hahsburg Empire which, in consequence of its German set=C2=AC=20
tlement, not only was the historic cause of the very formation of=20
this state, but whose population, moreover, exclusively demon=C2=AC=20
strated that power which for so many centuries was able to give=20
this structure, so artificial in the political sense, its inner cultural=20
life. As time progressed, the existence and future of this state=20
came to depend more and more on the preservation of this nuclear=20
cell of the Empire.=20


Vienna=E2=80=99s Last Revival=20


69=20


If the old hereditary territories were the heart of the Empire,=20
continually driving fresh blood into the circulatory stream of=20
political and cultural life, Vienna was the brain and will in one.=20

Its mere outward appearance justified one in attributing to this=20
city the power to reign as a unifying queen amid such a conglom=C2=AC=20
eration of peoples, thus by the radiance of her own beauty causing=20
us to forget the ugly symptoms of old age in the structure as a=20
whole.=20

The Empire might quiver and quake beneath the bloody battles=20
of the different nationalities, yet foreigners, and especially Ger=C2=AC=20
mans, saw only the charming countenance of this city. Wbat=20
made the deception all the greater was that Vienna at that time=20
seemed engaged in what was perhaps its last and greatest visible=20
revival. Under the rule of a truly gifted mayor, the venerable=20
residence of the Emperors of the old regime awoke once more to a=20

man greater than all the so-called =E2=80=98diplomats=E2=80=99 of the time.=

If the conglomeration of nations called =E2=80=98Austria=E2=80=99 neverthel=
ess=20
perished in the end, this does not detract in the least from the=20
political ability of the Germans in the old Ostmark, but was the=20
necessary result of the impossibility of permanently maintaining=20
a state of fifty million people of different nationalities by means=20
of ten million people, unless certain definite prerequisites were=20
established in time.=20

The ideas of the German-Austrian were more than grandiose.=20

He had always been accustomed to living in a great empire and=20
had never lost his feeling for the tasks bound up with it. He was=20
the only one in this state who, beyond the narrow boundaries of=20
the crown lands, still saw the boundaries of the Reich; indeed,=20
when Fate finally parted him from the common fatherland, he=20


70=20


Mein Kampe=20


kept on striving to master the gigantic task and preserve for the=20
German people what his fathers had once wrested from the East=20
in endless struggles. In this connection it should be borne in mind=20
that this had to be done with divided energy; for the heart and=20
memory of the best never ceased to feel for the common mother=20
country, and only a remnant was left for the homeland.=20

The general horizon of the German-Austrian was in itself com=C2=AC=20
paratively broad. His economic connections frequently embraced=20
almost the entire multiform Empire. Nearly all the big business=20
enterprises were in his hands; the directing personnel, both tech=C2=AC=20
nicians and officials, were in large part provided by him. He was=20
also in charge of foreign trade in so far as the Jews had not laid=20
their hands on this domain, which they have always seized for=20
their own. Politically, he alone held the state together. Military=20
service alone cast him. far beyond the narrow boundaries of his=20
homeland. The German-Austrian recruit might join a German=20
regiment, but the regiment itself might equally well, be in Herze=C2=AC=20
govina, Vienna, or Galicia. The officers 5 corps was still German,=20
the higher officials predominantly so. Finally, art and science=20
were German. Aside from the trash of the more modern artistic=20
development, wffiich a nation of Negroes might just as well have=20
produced, the German alone possessed and disseminated a truly=20
artistic attitude. In music, architecture, sculpture, and painting,=20
Vienna was the source supplying the entire dual monarchy in in=C2=AC=20
exhaustible abundance, without ever seeming to go dry itself.=20

Finally, the Germans directed the entire foreign policy if we=20
disregard a small number of Hungarians.=20

And yet any attempt to preserve this Empire was in vain, for=20
the most essential premise was lacking.=20

For the Austrian state of nationalities there was only one pos=C2=AC=20
sibility of overcoming the centrifugal forces of the individual na=C2=AC=20
tions. Either the state was centrally governed, hence internally=20
organized along the same lines, or it was altogether inconceivable.=20

At various lucid moments this insight dawned on the =E2=80=98 supreme =E2=
=80=99=20
authority. But as a rule it was soon forgotten or shelved as diffi=C2=AC=20
cult of execution. Any thought of a more federative organization=20


i=20


Centrifugal Forces=20


71=20


of the Empire was doomed to failure owing to the lack of a strong=20
political germ-cell of outstanding power. Added to this were the=20
internal conditions of the Austrian state which differed essen=C2=AC=20
tially from the German Empire of Bismarck. In Germany it was=20
only a question of overcoming political conditions, since there=20
was always a common cultural foundation. Above all, the Reich,=20
aside from little foreign splinters, embraced members of only one=20
people.=20

In Austria the opposite was the case.=20

Here the individual provinces, aside from Hungary, lacked any=20
political memory of their own greatness, or it had been erased by=20
the sponge of time, or at least blurred and obscured. In the period=20
when the principle of nationalities was developing, however, na=C2=AC=20
tional forces rose up in the various provinces, and to counteract=20
them was all the more difficult as on the rim of the monarchy=20
national states began to form whose populations, racially equiva=C2=AC=20
lent or related to the Austrian national splinters, were now able=20
to exert a greater power of attraction than, conversely, re=C2=AC=20
mained possible for the German-Austrian.=20

Even Vienna could not forever endure this struggle.=20

With the development of Budapest into a big city, she had for=20
the first time a rival whose task was no longer to hold the entire=20
monarchy together, but rather to strengthen a part of it. In a=20
short time Prague was to follow her example, then Lemberg,=20
Laibach, etc. With the rise of these former provincial cities to=20
national capitals of individual provinces, centers formed for more=20
or less independent cultural life in these provinces. And only=20
then did the politico-national instincts obtain their spiritual=20
foundation and depth. The time inevitably approached when=20
these dynamic forces of the individual peoples would grow=20
stronger than the force of common interests, and that would be=20
the end of Austria.=20

Since the death of Joseph II 1 the course of this development=20

1 Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1765-1790). Until 1780 he shared the=20
throne with his mother, Maria Theresa. From 1780 till his death he ruled=20
alone. Hostile to the clergy and nobility, he made a great effort to unify =
and=20


72=20


Mein Kampf=20


was clearly discernible. Its rapidity depended on a series of fac=C2=AC=20
tors which in part lay in the monarchy itself and in part were the=20
result of the Empire=E2=80=99s momentary position on foreign policy.=20

If the fight for the preservation of this state was to be taken up=20
and carried on in earnest, only a ruthless and persistent policy of=20
centralization could lead to the goal. First of all, the purely=20
formal cohesion had to be emphasized by the establishment in=20
principle of a uniform official language, and the administration=20
had to be given the technical implement without which a unified=20
state simply cannot exist. Likewise a unified state-consciousness=20
could only be bred for any length of time by schools and education.=20
This was not feasible in ten or twenty years; it was inevitably a=20
matter of centuries; for in all questions of colonization, persist=C2=AC=20
ence assumes greater importance than the energy of the moment.=20

It goes without saying that the administration as'well as the=20
political direction must be conducted with strict uniformity. To=20
me it was infinitely instructive to ascertain why this did not=20
occur, or rather, why it was not done. 1 He who was guilty of this=20
omission was alone to blame for the collapse of the Empire.=20

Old Austria more than any other state depended on the great=C2=AC=20
ness of her leaders. The foundation was lacking for a national=20
state, which in its national basis always possesses the power of=20
survival, regardless how deficient the leadership as such may be.=20
A homogeneous national state can, by virtue of the natural in=C2=AC=20
ertia of its inhabitants, and the resulting power of resistance,=20
sometimes withstand astonishingly long periods of the worst ad=C2=AC=20
ministration or leadership without inwardly disintegrating. At=20
such times it often seems as though there were no more life in=20
such a body, as though it were dead and done for, but one fine=20
day the supposed corpse suddenly rises and gives the rest of=20

stored it after bitter opposition from the Hungarians. He had a plan to joi=

humanity astonishing indications of its unquenchable vital force.=20

It is different, however, with an empire not consisting of similar=20
peoples, which is held together, not by common blood but by a=20
common fist. In this case the weakness of leadership will not=20
cause a hibernation of the state, but an awakening of all the indi=C2=AC=20
vidual instincts which are present in the blood, but cannot de=C2=AC=20
velop in times when there is a dominant will. Only by a common=20
education extending over centuries, by common tradition, com=C2=AC=20
mon interests, etc., can this danger be attenuated. Hence the=20
younger such state formations are, the more they depend on the=20
greatness of leadership, and if they are the work of outstanding=20
soldiers and spiritual heroes, they often crumble immediately=20
after the death of the great solitary founder. But even after cen=C2=AC=20
turies these dangers cannot be regarded as overcome; they only=20
lie dormant, often suddenly to awaken as soon as the weakness of=20
the common leadership and the force of education and all the=20
sublime traditions can no longer overcome the impetus of the=20
vital urge of the individual tribes.=20

Not to have understood this is perhaps the tragic guilt of the=20
House of Habsburg.=20

For only a single one of them did Fate once again raise high the=20
torch over the future of his country, then it was extinguished for=C2=AC=20
ever.=20

Joseph II, Roman Emperor of the German nation, saw with=20
fear and trepidation how his House, forced to the outermost=20
corner of the Empire, would one day inevitably vanish in the=20
maelstrom of a Babylon of nations unless at the eleventh hour=20
the omissions of his forefathers were made good. With super=C2=AC=20
human power this *friend of man=E2=80=99, braced himself against the=20
negligence of his ancestors and endeavored to retrieve in one=20
decade what centuries had failed to do. If he had been granted=20
only forty years for his work, and if after him even two genera=C2=AC=20
tions had continued his work as he began it, the miracle would=20
probably have been achieved. But when, after scarcely ten years=20
on the throne, worn in body and soul, he died, his work sank with=20
him into the grave, to awaken no more and sleep forever in the=20

Capuchin crypt. His successors were equal to the task neither in=20
mind nor in will.=20

When the first revolutionary lightnings of a new era flashed=20
through Europe, Austria, too, slowly began to catch fire, little by=20
little. But when the fire at length broke out, the flame was fanned=20
less by social or general political causes than by dynamic forces=20
of national origin.=20

The revolution of 1848 may have been a class struggle every=C2=AC=20
where, but in Austria it was the beginning of a new racial war.=20
By forgetting or not recognizing this origin and putting them=C2=AC=20
selves in the service of the revolutionary uprising, the Germans=20
sealed their own fate. They helped to arouse the spirit of =E2=80=98 West=
=C2=AC=20
ern democracy,=E2=80=99 which in a short time removed the foundations=20
of their own existence.=20

With the formation of a parliamentary representative body=20
without the previous establishment and crystallization of a com=C2=AC=20
mon state language, the cornerstone had been laid for the end of=20
German domination of the monarchy. 1 From this moment on the=20
state itself was lost. All that followed was merely the historic=20
liquidation of an empire.=20

To follow this process of dissolution was as heartrending as it=20
was instructive. This execution of an historical sentence was car=C2=AC=20
ried out in detail in thousands and thousands of forms. The fact=20
that a large part of the people moved blindly through the mani=C2=AC=20
festations of decay showed only that the gods had willed Aus=C2=AC=20

I shall not lose myself in details on this point, for that is not the=20
function of this book. I shall only submit to a more thorough=C2=AC=20

At the head of those institutions which could most clearly have=20
revealed the erosion of the Austrian monarchy, even to a shop=C2=AC=20
keeper not otherwise gifted with sharp eyes, was one which ought=20
to have had the greatest strength =E2=80=94 parliament, or, as it was=20
called in Austria, the Reichsrat.=20

Obviously the example of this body had been taken from Eng=C2=AC=20
land, the land of classical =E2=80=98democracy.=E2=80=99 From there the who=
le=20
blissful institution was taken and transferred as unchanged as=20
possible to Vienna.=20

The English two-chamber system was solemnly resurrected in=20
the Abgeordnetenhaus and the Ilcrrenhaus . Except that the=20
=E2=80=98houses=E2=80=99 themselves were somewhat different. When Barry rai=
sed=20
his parliament buildings from the waters of the Thames, he thrust=20
into the history of the British Empire and from it took the decora=C2=AC=20
tions for the twelve hundred niches, consoles, and pillars of his=20
magnificent edifice. Thus, in their sculpture and painting, the=20
House of Lords and the House of Commons became the nation=E2=80=99s=20
Hall of Fame.=20

This was where the first difficulty came in for Vienna. For=20
when Hansen, the Danish builder, had completed the last pin=C2=AC=20
nacle on the marble building of the new parliament, there was=20
nothing he could use as decoration except borrowings from an=C2=AC=20
tiquity. Roman and Greek statesmen and philosophers now em=C2=AC=20
bellish this opera house of Western democracy, and in symbolic=20
irony the quadrigae fly from one another in all four directions=20
above the two houses, in this way giving the best external expres=C2=AC=20

The =E2=80=98nationalities=E2=80=99 had vetoed the glorification of Austria=

Reich itself it was only beneath the thunder of World War battles=20
that they dared to dedicate Wallot=E2=80=99s Reichstag Building to the=20
German people by an inscription.=20

When, not yet twenty years old, I set foot for the first time in=20
the magnificent building on the Franzensring to attend a session=20
of the House of Deputies as a spectator and listener, I was seized=20
with the most conflicting sentiments.=20


76=20


Mein Kampf=20


I had always hated parliament, but not as an institution in=20
itself. On the contrary, as a freedom-loving man I could not even=20
conceive of any other possibility of government, for the idea of=20
any sort of dictatorship would, in view of my attitude toward the=20
House of Habsburg, have seemed to me a crime against freedom=20
and all reason.=20

What contributed no little to this was that as a young man, in=20
consequence of my extensive newspaper reading, I had, without=20
myself realizing it, been inoculated with a certain admiration for=20
the British Parliament, of which I was not easily able to rid my=C2=AC=20
self. The dignity with which the Lower House there fulfilled its=20
tasks (as was so touchingly described in our press) impressed me=20
immensely. Could a people have any more exalted form of self-=20
government?=20

But for this very reason I was an enemy of the Austrian parlia=C2=AC=20
ment. I considered its whole mode of conduct unworthy of the=20
great example. To this the following was now added:=20

The fate of the Germans in the Austrian state was dependent=20
on their position in the Reichsrat. Up to the introduction of uni=C2=AC=20
versal and secret suffrage, the Germans had had a majority,=20
though an insignificant one, in parliament. Even this condition=20
was precarious, for the Social Democrats, with their unreliable=20
attitude in national questions, always turned against German=20
interests in critical matters affecting the Germans =E2=80=94 in order not=
=20
to alienate the members of the various foreign nationalities.=20
Even in those days the Social Democracy could not be regarded=20
as a German party. And with the introduction of universal suf=C2=AC=20
frage the German superiority ceased even in a purely numerical=20
sense. There was no longer any obstacle in the path of the further=20
de-Germanization of the state.=20

For this reason my instinct of national self-preservation caused=20
me even in those days to have little love for a representative body=20
in which the Germans were always misrepresented rather than=20
represented. Yet these were deficiencies which, like so many=20
others, were attributable, not to the thing in itself, but to the=20
Austrian state. I still believed that if a German majority were=20


Parliamentarianism=20


77=20


restored in the representative bodies, there would no longer be=20
any reason for a principled opposition to them, that is, as long as=20
the old state continued to exist at all.=20

These were my inner sentiments when for the first time I set=20
foot in these halls as hallowed as they were disputed. For me, to=20
be sure, they were hallowed only by the lofty beauty of the mag=C2=AC=20
nificent building. A Hellenic miracle on German soil!=20

How soon was I to grow indignant when I saw the lamentable=20
comedy that unfolded beneath my eyes!=20

Present were a few hundred of these popular representatives=20
who had to take a position on a question of most vital economic=20
importance.=20

The very first day was enough to stimulate me to thought for=20
weeks on end.=20

The intellectual content of what these men said was on a really=20
depressing level, in so far as you could understand their babbling=20
at all; for several of the gentlemen did not speak German, but=20
their native Slavic languages or rather dialects. I now had occa=C2=AC=20
sion to hear with my own ears what previously I had known only=20
from reading the newspapers. A wild gesticulating mass scream=C2=AC=20
ing all at once in every different key, presided over by a good-=20
natured old uncle who was striving in the sweat of his brow to=20
revive the dignity of the House by violently ringing his bell and=20
alternating gentle reproofs with grave admonitions.=20

I couldn=E2=80=99t help laughing.=20

A few weeks later I was in the House again. The picture was=20
changed beyond recognition. The hall was absolutely empty.=20
Down below everybody was asleep. A few deputies were in their=20
places, yawning at one another; one was =E2=80=98speaking.=E2=80=99 A vice-=
=20
president of the House was present, looking into the hall with=20
obvious boredom.=20

The first misgivings arose in me. From now on, whenever=20
time offered me the slightest opportunity, I went back and, with=20
silence and attention, viewed whatever picture presented itself,=20
listened to the speeches in so far as they were intelligible, studied=20
the more or less intelligent faces of the elect of the peoples of=20


78=20


Mein Kampe=20


this woe-begone state =E2=80=94 and little by little formed my own=20
ideas.=20

A year of this tranquil observation sufficed totally to change or=20
eliminate my former view of the nature of this institution. My=20
innermost position was no longer against the misshapen form=20
which this idea assumed in Austria; no, by now I could no longer=20
accept the parliament as such. Up till then I had seen the mis=C2=AC=20
fortune of the Austrian parliament in the absence of a German=20
majority; now I saw that its ruination lay in the whole nature=20
and essence of the institution as such.=20

A whole series of questions rose up in me.=20

I began to make myself familiar with the democratic principle=20
of majority rule as the foundation of this whole institution, but=20
devoted no less attention to the intellectual and moral values of=20
these gentlemen, supposedly the elect of the nations, who were=20
expected to serve this purpose.=20

Thus I came to know the institution and its representatives at=20
once.=20

In the course of a few years, my knowledge and insight shaped=20
a plastic model of that most dignified phenomenon of modern=20
times: the parliamentarian. He began to impress himself upon=20
me in a form which has never since been subjected to any essen=C2=AC=20
tial change.=20

Here again the visual instruction of practical reality had pre=C2=AC=20
vented me from being stifled by a theory which at first sight=20
seemed seductive to so many, but which none the less must be=20
counted among the symptoms of human degeneration.=20

The Western democracy of today is the forerunner of Marxism=20
which without it would not be thinkable. It provides this world=20
plague with the culture in which its germs can spread. In its=20
most extreme form, parliamentarianism created a 1 monstrosity of=20
excrement and fire/ 1 in which, however, sad to say, the =E2=80=98fire=E2=
=80=99=20
seems to me at the moment to be burned out.=20

I must be more than thankful to Fate for laying this question=20

Parliamentarianism=20


79=20


before me while I was in Vienna, for I fear that in Germany at=20
that time I would have found the answer too easily. For if I had=20
first encountered this absurd institution known as =E2=80=98parliament=E2=
=80=99 in=20
Berlin, I might have fallen into the opposite fallacy, and not=20
without seemingly good cause have sided with those who saw the=20
salvation of the people and the Reich exclusively in furthering=20
the power of the imperial idea, and who nevertheless were alien=20
and blind at once to the times and the people involved.=20

In Austria this was impossible.=20

Here it was not so easy to go from one mistake to the other. If=20
parliament was worthless, the Habsburgs were even more worth=C2=AC=20
less=E2=80=94 in no event, less so. To reject =E2=80=98parliamentarianism=
=E2=80=99 was=20
not enough, for the question still remained open: what then? The=20
rejection and abolition of the Reichsrat would have left the House=20
of Habsburg the sole governing force, a thought which, especially=20
for me, was utterly intolerable.=20

The difficulty of this special case led me to a more thorough=20
contemplation of the problem as such than would otherwise have=20
been likely at such tender years.=20

What gave me most food for thought was the obvious absence=20
of any responsibility in a single person.=20

The parliament arrives at some decision whose consequences=20
may be ever so ruinous =E2=80=94 nobody bears any responsibility for=20
this, no one can be taken to account. For can it be called an ac=C2=AC=20
ceptance of responsibility if, after an unparalleled catastrophe,=20
the guilty government resigns? Or if the coalition changes, or=20
even if parliament is itself dissolved?=20

Can a fluctuating majority of people ever be made responsible=20
in any case?=20

Isn=E2=80=99t the very idea of responsibility bound up with the individ=C2=
=AC=20
ual?=20

But can an individual directing a government be made practi=C2=AC=20
cally responsible for actions whose preparation and execution=20
must be set exclusively to the account of the will and inclination=20
of a multitude of men?=20

Or will not the task of a leading statesman be seen, not in the=20


80=20


Mein Kampf=20


birth of a creative idea or plan as such, but rather in the art of=20
making the brilliance of his projects intelligible to a herd of sheep=20
and blockheads, and subsequently begging for their kind ap=C2=AC=20
proval?=20

Is it the criterion of the statesman that he should possess the=20
art of persuasion in as high degree as that of political intelligence=20
in formulating great policies or decisions? Is the incapacity of a=20
leader shown by the fact that he does not succeed in winning for a=20
certain idea the majority of a mob thrown together by more or=20
less savory accidents?=20

Indeed, has this mob ever understood an idea before success=20
proclaimed its greatness?=20

Isn=E2=80=99t every deed of genius in this world a visible protest of=20
genius against the inertia of the mass?=20

And what should the statesman do, who does not succeed=20
in gaining the favor of this mob for his plans by flattery?=20

Should he buy it?=20

Or, in view of the stupidity of his fellow citizens, should he re=C2=AC=20
nounce the execution of the tasks which he has recognized to be=20
vital necessities? Should he resign or should he remain at his post?=20

In such a case, doesn=E2=80=99t a man of true character find himself in a=

hopeless conflict between knowledge and decency, or rather hon=C2=AC=20

Where is the dividing line between his duty toward the general=20
public and his duty toward his personal honor?=20

Mustn=E2=80=99t every true leader refuse to be thus degraded to the=20
level of a political gangster?=20

And, conversely, mustn=E2=80=99t every gangster feel that he is cut out=20
for politics, since it is never he, but some intangible mob, which=20
has to bear the ultimate responsibility?=20

Mustn=E2=80=99t our principle of parliamentary majorities lead to the=20
demolition of any idea of leadership?=20

Does anyone believe that the progress of this world springs=20
from the mind of majorities and not from the brains of individuals?=20

The Exclusion of Individual Leadership=20

Does it not, on the contrary, today seem more indispensable=20
than ever?=20

By rejecting the authority of the individual and replacing it by=20
the numbers of some momentary mob, the parliamentary princi=C2=AC=20
ple of majority rule sins against the basic aristocratic principle of=20
Nature, though it must be said that this view is not necessarily=20
embodied in the present-day decadence of our upper ten thou=C2=AC=20

The devastation caused by this institution of modern parlia=C2=AC=20
mentary rule is hard for the reader of Jewish newspapers to imag=C2=AC=20
ine, unless he has learned to think and examine independently.=20
It is, first and foremost, the cause of the incredible inundation of=20
all political life with the most inferior, and I mean the most=20
inferior, characters of our time. Just as the true leader will with=C2=AC=
=20
draw from all political activity which does not consist primarily=20
in creative achievement and work, but in bargaining and hag=C2=AC=20
gling for the favor of the majority, in the same measure this=20

=C2=ABr=20

activity will suit the small mind and consequently attract it.=20

The more dwarfish one of these present-day leather-merchants=20
is in spirit and ability, the more clearly his own insight makes=20
him aware of the lamentable figure he actually cuts =E2=80=94 that much=20
more will he sing the praises of a system which does not demand=20
of him the power and genius of a giant, but is satisfied with the=20
craftiness of a village mayor, preferring in fact this kind of wis=C2=AC=20
dom to that of a Pericles. And this kind doesn't have to torment=20
himself with responsibility for his actions. He is entirely re=C2=AC=20
moved from such worry, for he well knows that, regardless what=20
the result of his * statesmanlike' bungling may be, his end has=20
long been written in the stars: one day he will have to cede his=20
place to another equally great mind, for it is one of the character=C2=AC=
=20
istics of this decadent system that the number of great statesmen=20
increases in proportion as the stature of the individual decreases.=20
With increasing dependence on parliamentary majorities it will=20
inevitably continue to shrink, since on the one hand great minds=20
will refuse to be the stooges of idiotic incompetents and big-=20
mouths, and on the other, conversely, the representatives of the=20


82=20


Mein Kampf=20


majority, hence of stupidity, hate nothing more passionately=20
than a superior mind.=20

For such an assembly of wise men of Gotham, it is always a=20
consolation to know that they are headed by a leader whose in=C2=AC=20
telligence is at the level of those present: this will give each one=20
the pleasure of shining from time to time =E2=80=94 and, above all, if=20
Tom can be master, what is to prevent Dick and Harry from=20
having their turn too?=20

This invention of democracy is most intimately related to a=20
quality which in recent times has grown to be a real disgrace, to=20
wit, the cowardice of a great part of our so-called =E2=80=98leadership.=E2=
=80=99=20
What luck to be able to hide behind the skirts of a so-called ma=C2=AC=20
jority in all decisions of any real importance!=20

Take a look at one of these political bandits. How anxiously=20
he begs the approval of the majority for every measure, to assure=20
himself of the necessary accomplices, so he can unload the re=C2=AC=20
sponsibility at any time. And this is one of the main reasons why=20
this type of political activity is always repulsive and hateful to=20
any man who is decent at heart and hence courageous, while it=20
attracts all low characters =E2=80=94 and anyone who is unwilling to=20
take personal responsibility for his acts, but seeks a shield, is a=20
cowardly scoundrel. When the leaders of a nation consist of such=20
vile creatures, the results will soon be deplorable. Such a nation=20
will be unable to muster the courage for any determined act; it=20
will prefer to accept any dishonor, even the most shameful, rather=20
than rise to a decision; for there is no one who is prepared of his=20
own accord to pledge his person and his head for the execution of=20
a dauntless resolve.=20

For there is one thing which we must never forget: in this, too,=20
the majority can never replace the man. It is not only a repre=C2=AC=20
sentative of stupidity, but of cowardice as well. And no more=20
than a hundred empty heads make one wise man will an heroic=20
decision arise from a hundred cowards.=20

The less the responsibility of the individual leader, the more=20
numerous will be those who, despite their most insignificant=20
stature, feel called upon to put their immortal forces in the=20


The Exclusion of Individual Leadership=20


83=20


service of the nation. Indeed, they will be unable to await their=20
turn; they stand in a long line, and with pain and regret count the=20
number of those waiting ahead of them, calculating almost the=20
precise hour at which, in all probability, their turn will come.=20
Consequently, they long for any change in the office hovering=20
before their eyes, and are thankful for any scandal which thins=20
out the ranks ahead of them. And if some man is unwilling to=20
move from the post he holds, this in their eyes is practically a=20
breach of a holy pact of solidarity. They grow vindictive, and=20
they do not rest until the impudent fellow is at last overthrown,=20
thus turning his warm place back to the public. And, rest as=C2=AC=20
sured, he won=E2=80=99t recover the position so easily. For as soon as one=
=20
of these creatures is forced to give up a position, he will try at=20
once to wedge his way into the =E2=80=98 waiting-line =E2=80=99 unless the =
hue and=20
cry raised by the others prevents him.=20

The consequence of all this is a terrifying turn-over in the most=20
important offices and positions of such a state, a result which is=20
always harmful, but sometimes positively catastrophic. For it is=20
not only the simpleton and incompetent who will fall victim to=20
this custom, but to an even greater extent the real leader, if Fate=20
somehow manages to put one in this place. As soon as this fact=20
has been recognized, a solid front will form against him, especially=20
if such a mind has not arisen from their own ranks, but none the=20
less dares to enter into this exalted society. For on principle=20
these gentry like to be among themselves and they hate as a=20
common enemy any brain which stands even slightly above the=20
zeros. And in this respect their instinct is as much sharper as it=20
is deficient in everything else.=20

The result will be a steadily expanding intellectual impoverish=C2=AC=20
ment of the leading circles. The result for the nation and the=20
state, everyone can judge for himself, excepting in so far as he=20
himself is one of these kind of c leaders.=E2=80=99=20

Old Austria possessed the parliamentary regime in its purest=20
form.=20

To be sure, the prime ministers were always appointed by the=20
Emperor and King, but this very appointment was nothing but=20


84=20


Mein Kampf=20


the execution of the parliamentary will. The haggling and bar=C2=AC=20
gaining for the individual portfolios represented Western democ=C2=AC=20
racy of the first water. And the results corresponded to the=20
principles applied. Particularly the change of individual personal=C2=AC=20
ities occurred in shorter and shorter terms, ultimately becoming a=20
veritable chase. In the same measure, the stature of the =E2=80=98 states=
=C2=AC=20
men=E2=80=99 steadily diminished until finally no one remained but that=20
type of parliamentary gangster whose statesmanship could only=20
be measured and recognized by their ability in pasting together=20
the coalitions of the moment; in other words, concluding those=20
pettiest of political bargains which alone demonstrate the fitness=20
of these representatives of the people for practical work.=20

Thus the Viennese school transmitted the best impressions in=20
this field.=20

But what attracted me no less was to compare the ability and=20
knowledge of these representatives of the people and the tasks=20
which awaited them. In this case, whether I liked it or not, I was=20
impelled to examine more closely the intellectual horizon of these=20
elect of the nations themselves, and in so doing, I could not avoid=20
giving the necessary attention to the processes which lead to the=20
discovery of these ornaments of our public life.=20

The way in which the real ability of these gentlemen was ap=C2=AC=20
plied and placed in the service of the fatherland =E2=80=94 in other words,=
=20
the technical process of their activity =E2=80=94 was also worthy of=20
thorough study and investigation.=20

The more determined I was to penetrate these inner conditions,=20
to study the personalities and material foundations with daunt=C2=AC=20
less and penetrating objectivity, the more deplorable became my=20
total picture of parliamentary life. Indeed, this is an advisable=20
procedure in dealing with an institution which, in the person of=20
its representatives, feels obliged to bring up 1 objectivity =E2=80=99 in e=
very=20
second sentence as the only proper basis for every investigation=20
and opinion. Investigate these gentlemen themselves and the laws=20
of their sordid existence, and you will be amazed at the result.=20

There is no principle which, objectively considered, is as false=20

that of parliamentarianism.=20


=E2=80=98 Public Opinion =E2=80=99=20


85=20


Here we may totally disregard the manner in which our fine=20
representatives of the people are chosen, how they arrive at their=20
office and their new dignity. That only the tiniest fraction of=20
them rise in fulfillment of a general desire, let alone a need, will=20
at once be apparent to anyone who realizes that the political=20
understanding of the broad masses is far from being highly enough=20
developed to arrive at definite general political views of their own=20
accord and seek out the suitable personalities.=20

The thing we designate by the word =E2=80=98public opinion=E2=80=99 rests o=
nly=20
in the smallest part on experience or knowledge which the in=C2=AC=20
dividual has acquired by himself, but rather on an idea which is=20
inspired by so-called =E2=80=98enlightenment/ often of a highly persistent=
=20
and obtrusive type.=20

Just as a man=E2=80=99s denominational orientation is the result of up=C2=
=AC=20
bringing, and only the religious need as such slumbers in his soul,=20
the political opinion of the masses represents nothing but the=20
final result of an incredibly tenacious and thorough manipulation=20
of their mind and soul.=20

By far the greatest share in their political =E2=80=98education,=E2=80=99 w=
hich=20
in this case is most aptly designated by the word =E2=80=98propaganda,=E2=
=80=99=20
falls to the account of the press. It is foremost in performing this=20
=E2=80=98work of enlightenment=E2=80=99 and thus represents a sort of schoo=
l for=20
grown-ups. This instruction, however, is not in the hands of the=20
state, but in the claws of forces which are in part very inferior.=20
In Vienna as a very young man I had the best opportunity to=20
become acquainted with the owners and spiritual manufacturers=20
of this machine for educating the masses. At first I could not=20
help but be amazed at how short a time it took this great evil=20
power within the state to create a certain opinion even where it=20
meant totally falsifying profound desires and views which surely=20
existed among the public. In a few days a ridiculous episode had=20
become a significant state action, while, conversely, at the same=20
time, vital problems fell a prey to public oblivion, or rather were=20
simply filched from the memory and consciousness of the masses.=20

Thus, in the course of a few weeks it was possible to conjure=20
up names out of the void, to associate them with incredible hopes=20


86=20


Mein Kampf=20


on the part of the broad public, even to give them a popularity=20
which the really great man often does not obtain his whole life=20
long; names which a month before no one had even seen or heard=20
of, while at the same time old and proved figures of political or=20
other public life, though in the best of health, simply died as far=20
as their fellow men were concerned, or were heaped with such=20
vile insults that their names soon threatened to become the sym=C2=AC=20
bol of some definite act of infamy or villainy. We must study this=20
vile Jewish technique of emptying garbage pails full of the vilest=20
slanders and defamations from hundreds and hundreds of sources=20
at once, suddenly and as if by magic, on the clean garments of=20
honorable men, if we are fully to appreciate the entire menace=20
represented by these scoundrels of the press.=20

There is absolutely nothing one of these spiritual robber-=20
barons will not do to achieve his savory aims.=20

He will poke into the most secret family affairs and not rest=20
until his truffle-searching instinct digs up some miserable incident=20
which is calculated to finish off the unfortunate victim. But if,=20
after the most careful sniffing, absolutely nothing is found, either=20
in the man=E2=80=99s public or private life, one of these scoundrels simply=
=20
seizes on slander, in the firm conviction that despite a thousand=20
refutations something always sticks and, moreover, through the=20
immediate and hundredfold repetition of his defamations by all=20
his accomplices, any resistance on the part of the victim is in=20
most cases utterly impossible; and it must be borne in mind that=20
this rabble never acts out of motives which might seem credible=20
or even understandable to the rest of humanity. God forbid!=20
While one of these scum is attacking his beloved fellow men in=20
the most contemptible fashion, the octopus covers himself with a=20
veritable cloud of respectability and unctuous phrases, prates=20
about =E2=80=98journalistic duty=E2=80=99 and such-like lies, and even goes=
 so far=20
as to shoot off his mouth at committee meetings and congresses =E2=80=94=20
that is, occasions where these pests are present in large numbers=20
=E2=80=94 about a very special variety of =E2=80=98honor/ to wit, the journ=
alistic=20
variety, which the assembled rabble gravely and mutually con=C2=AC=20

The Majority Principle=20


87=20


These scum manufacture more than three quarters of the so-=20
called 4 public opinion/ from whose foam the parliamentarian=20
Aphrodite arises. To give an accurate description of this process=20
and depict it in all its falsehood and improbability, one would=20
have to write volumes. But even if we disregard all this and=20
examine only the given product along with its activity, this=20
seems to me enough to make the objective lunacy of this institution=20
dawn on even the naivest mind.=20

This human error, as senseless as it is dangerous, will most=20
readily be understood as soon as we compare democratic parlia-=20
mentarianism with a truly Germanic democracy.=20

The distinguishing feature of the former is that a body of, let=20
us say five hundred men, or in recent times even women, is chosen=20
and entrusted with making the ultimate decision in any and all=20
matters. And so for practical purposes they alone are the govern=C2=AC=20
ment ; for even if they do choose a cabinet which undertakes the=20
external direction of the affairs of state, this is a mere sham. In=20
reality this so-called government cannot take a step without first=20
obtaining the approval of the general assembly. Consequently,=20
it cannot be made responsible for anything, since the ultimate=20
decision never lies with it, but with the majority of parliament.=20
In every case it does nothing but carry out the momentary will=20
of the majority. Its political ability can only be judged according=20
to the skill with which it understands how either to adapt itself=20
to the will of the majority or to pull the majority over to its side.=20
Thereby it sinks from the heights of real government to the level=20
of a beggar confronting the momentary majority. Indeed, its=20
most urgent task becomes nothing more than either to secure the=20
favor of the existing majority, as the need arises, or to form a=20
majority with more friendly inclinations. If this succeeds, it may=20
=E2=80=98govern=E2=80=99 a little while longer; if it doesn=E2=80=99t succe=
ed, it can resign.=20
The soundness of its purposes as such is beside the point.=20

For practical purposes, this excludes all responsibility.=20

To what consequences this leads can be seen from a few simple=20
considerations:=20

The internal composition of the five hundred chosen repre-=20


88=20


Mein Kampf=20


sentatives of the people, with regard to profession or even in=C2=AC=20
dividual abilities, gives a picture as incoherent as it is usually=20
deplorable. For no one can believe that these men elected by the=20
nation are elect of spirit or even of intelligence! It is to be hoped=20
that no one will suppose that the ballots of an electorate which is=20
anything else than brilliant will give rise to statesmen by the=20
hundreds. Altogether we cannot be too sharp in condemning the=20
absurd notion that geniuses can be born from general elections.=20
In the first place, a nation only produces a real statesman once=20
in a blue moon and not a hundred or more at once; and in the=20
second place, the revulsion of the masses for every outstanding=20
genius is positively instinctive. Sooner will a camel pass through=20
a needle=E2=80=99s eye than a great man be =E2=80=98discovered=E2=80=99 by =
an election.=20

In world history the man who really rises above the norm of=20
the broad average usually announces himself personally.=20

As it is, however, five hundred men, whose stature is to say the=20
least modest, vote on the most important affairs of the nation,=20
appoint governments which in every single case and in every=20
special question have to get the approval of the exalted assembly,=20
so that policy is really made by five hundred.=20

And that is just what it usually looks like.=20

But even leaving the genius of these representatives of the=20
people aside, bear in mind how varied are the problems awaiting=20
attention, in what widely removed fields solutions and decisions=20
must be made, and you will realize how inadequate a governing=20
institution must be which transfers the ultimate right of decision=20
to a mass assembly of people, only a tiny fraction of which possess=20
knowledge and experience of the matter to be treated. The most=20
important economic measures are thus submitted to a forum,=20
only a tenth of whose members have any economic education to=20
show. This is nothing more nor less than placing the ultimate=20
decision in a matter in the hands of men totally lacking in every=20
prerequisite for the task.=20

The same is true of every other question. The decision is always=20
made by a majority of ignoramuses and incompetents, since the=20
composition of this institution remains unchanged while the=20


The Majority Principle=20


89=20


problems under treatment extend to nearly every province of=20
public life and would thereby presuppose a constant turn-over in=20
the deputies who are to judge and decide on them, since it is im=C2=AC=20
possible to let the same persons decide matters of transportation=20
as, let us say, a question of high foi sign policy. Otherwise these=20
men would all have to be universal geniuses such as we actually=20
seldom encounter once in centuries. Unfortunately we are here=20
confronted, for the most part, not with =E2=80=98thinkers/ but with=20
dilettantes as limited as they are conceited and inflated, intel=C2=AC=20
lectual demi-monde of the worst sort. And this is the source of the=20
often incomprehensible frivolity with which these gentry speak=20
and decide on things which would require careful meditation even=20
in the greatest minds. Measures of the gravest significance for=20
the future of a whole state, yes, of a nation, are passed as though=20
a game of schafkopf or tarock / which would certainly be better=20
suited to their abilities, lay on the table before them and not the=20
fate of a race.=20

Yet it would surely be unjust to believe that all of the deputies=20
in such a parliament were personally endowed with so little sense=20
of responsibility.=20

No, by no means.=20

But by forcing the individual to take a position on such ques=C2=AC=20
tions completely ill-suited to him, this system gradually ruins=20
his character. No one will summon up the courage to declare:=20
=E2=80=98 Gentlemen, I believe we understand nothing about this matter.=20
I personally certainly do not.=E2=80=99 (Besides, this would change mat=C2=
=AC=20
ters little, for surely this kind of honesty would remain totally=20
unappreciated, and what is more, our friends would scarcely=20
allow one honorable jackass to spoil their whole game.) Anyone=20
with a knowledge of people will realize that in such an illustrious=20
company no one is eager to be the stupidest, and in certain circles=20
honesty is almost synonymous with stupidity.=20

Thus, even the representative who at first was honest is thrown=20

1 Schafkopf is a four-handed card-game widely played in Germany.=20
Tarock-, Three-handed card-game of Italian origin (tarocco), popular in Aus=
=C2=AC=20
tria and southern Germany.=20


90=20


Mein Kampf=20


into this track of general falsehood and deceit. The very convic=C2=AC=20
tion that the non-participation of an individual in the business=20
would in itself change nothing kills every honorable impulse=20
which may rise up in this or that deputy. And finally, moreover,=20
he may tell himself that he personally is far from being the worst=20
among the others , 1 and that the sole effect of his collaboration is=20
perhaps to prevent worse things from happening.=20

It will be objected, to be sure, that, though the individual=20
deputy possesses no special understanding in this or that matter,=20
his position has been discussed by the fraction which directs the=20
policy of the gentleman in question, and that the fraction has its=20
special committees which are more than adequately enlightened=20
by experts anyway.=20

At first glance this seems to be true. But then the question=20
arises: Why are five hundred chosen when only a few possess the=20
necessary wisdom to take a position in the most important=20
matters?=20

And this is the worm in the apple!=20

It is not the aim of our present-day parliamentarianism to con=C2=AC=20
stitute an assembly of wise men, but rather to compose a band of=20
mentally dependent nonentities who are the more easily led in=20
certain directions, the greater is the personal limitation of the=20
individual. That is the only way of carrying on party politics in=20
the malodorous present-day sense. And only in this way is it=20
possible for the real wirepuller to remain carefully in the back=C2=AC=20
ground and never personally be called to responsibility. For=20
then every decision, regardless how harmful to the nation, will=20
not be set to the account of a scoundrel visible to all, but will be=20
unloaded on the shoulders of a whole fraction.=20

And thereby every practical responsibility vanishes. For re=C2=AC=20
sponsibility can lie only in the obligation of an individual and not=20
in a parliamentary bull session.=20

Such an institution can only please the biggest liars and sneaks=20
of the sort that shun the light of day, because it is inevitably=20
hateful to an honorable, straightforward man who welcomes=20
personal responsibility.=20

Juxtaposed to this is the truly Germanic democracy character=C2=AC=20

there is no majority vote on individual questions, but only the=20
decision of an individual who must answer with his fortune and=20
his life for his choice.=20

If it be objected that under such conditions scarcely anyone=20
would be prepared to dedicate his person to so risky a task, there=20
is but one possible answer:=20

Thank the Lord, Germanic democracy means just this: that=20

govern his national comrades , 1 but that, by the very greatness of=20

Mein Kampf=20


I had fought my way to this conclusion after two years at=C2=AC=20
tendance at the Vienna parliament.=20

After that I never went back.=20

The parliamentary regime shared the chief blame for the weak=C2=AC=20
ness, constantly increasing in the past few years, of the Habsburg=20
state. The more its activities broke the predominance of the=20
Germans, the more the country succumbed to a system of play=C2=AC=20
ing off the nationalities against one another. In the Reichsrat=20
itself this was always done at the expense of the Germans and=20
thereby, in the last analysis, at the expense of the Empire; for by=20
the turn of the century it must have been apparent even to the=20
simplest that the monarchy=E2=80=99s force of attraction would no longer=20
be able to withstand the separatist tendencies of the provinces.=20

On the contrary.=20

The more pathetic became the means which the state had to=20
employ for its preservation, the more the general contempt for it=20
increased. Not only in Hungary, but also in the separate Slavic=20
provinces, people began to identify themselves so little with the=20
common monarchy that they did not regard its weakness as their=20
own disgrace. On the contrary, they rejoiced at such symptoms=20
of old age; for they hoped more for the Empire=E2=80=99s death than for=20
its recovery.=20

In parliament, for the moment, total collapse was averted by=20
undignified submissiveness and acquiescence at every extortion,=20
for which the German had to pay in the end; and in the country,=20
by most skillfully playing off the different peoples against each=20
other. But the general line of development was nevertheless di=C2=AC=20
rected against the Germans. Especially since Archduke Francis=20
Ferdinand 1 became heir apparent and began to enjoy a certain=20

1 Archduke Francis Ferdinand (1863-1914), brother of Francis Joseph,=20
became heir apparent to the Austrian throne in 1889 when Archduke Rudolf,=
=20
only son of Francis Joseph, committed suicide. Francis Ferdinand, who=20
favored a reorganization of the monarchy giving the Slavic population=20
equality with the Germans and Hungarians, was assassinated at Sarajevo=20
on June 28, 1914. Hitler=E2=80=99s talk of Czechization is an exaggeration,=
 to say=20
the least. The most that can be said is that some of the leaders of the=20
monarchy favored collaboration with the Slavic upper classes and some relie=
f=20
for the oppressed Slavic populations.=20


Habsburg and the German Element=20


93=20


influence, there began to be some plan and order in the policy of=20
Czechization from above. With all possible means, this future=20
ruler of the dual monarchy tried to encourage a policy of de-=20
Germanization, to advance it himself or at least to sanction it.=20
Purely German towns, indirectly through government ofhcial-=20
dom, were slowly but steadily pushed into the mixed-language=20
danger zones. Even in Lower Austria this process began to make=20
increasingly rapid progress, and many Czechs considered Vienna=20
their largest city.=20

The central idea of this new Habsburg, w r hose family had=20
ceased to speak anything but Czech (the Archduke=E2=80=99s wife, a=20
former Czech countess, had been morganatically married to the=20
Prince =E2=80=94 she came from circles whose anti-German attitude=20
was traditional), was gradually to establish a Slavic state in=20
Central Europe which for defense against Orthodox Russia=20
should be placed on a strictly Catholic basis. Thus, as the=20
Habsburgs had so often done before, religion was once again=20
put into the service of a purely political idea, and what was=20
worse =E2=80=94 at least from the German viewpoint =E2=80=94 of a catastrop=
hic=20
idea.=20

The result was more than dismal in many respects.=20

Neither the House of Habsburg nor the Catholic Church re=C2=AC=20
ceived the expected reward.=20

Habsburg lost the throne, Rome a great state.=20

For by employing religious forces in the service of its political=20
considerations, the crown aroused a spirit which at the outset it=20
had not considered possible.=20

In answer to the attempt to exterminate the Germans in the=20
old monarchy by every possible means, there arose the Pan-=20
German movement in Austria.=20

By the eighties the basic Jewish tendency of Manchester=20
liberalism had reached, if. not passed, its high point in the mon=C2=AC=20
archy. The reaction to it, however, as with everything in old=20
Austria, arose primarily from a social, not from a national stand=C2=AC=20
point. The instinct of self-preservation forced the Germans to=20
adopt the sharpest measures of defense. Only secondarily did=20


94=20


Mein Kampf=20


economic considerations begin to assume a decisive influence.=20
And so, two party formations grew out of the general political=20
confusion, the one with the more national, the other with the more=20
social, attitude, but both highly interesting and instructive for=20
the future.=20

After &gt; the depressing end of the War of 1866, the House of=20
Habsburg harbored the idea of revenge on the battlefield. Only=20
the death of Emperor Max of Mexico, whose unfortunate ex=C2=AC=20
pedition was blamed primarily on Napoleon III and whose=20
abandonment by the French aroused general indignation, pre=C2=AC=20
vented a closer collaboration with France. Habsburg neverthe=C2=AC=20
less lurkedin wait. If the War of 1870-71 had not been so unique=20
a triumph, the Vienna Court would probably have risked a=20
bloody venture to avenge Sadowa. But when the first amazing=20
and scarcely credible, but none the less true, tales of heroism=20
arrived from the battlefields, the =E2=80=98wisest=E2=80=99 of all monarchs=
 recog=C2=AC=20
nized that the hour was not propitious and put the best possible=20
face on a bad business.=20

But the heroic struggle of these years had accomplished an=20
even mightier miracle; for with the Habsburgs a change of posi=C2=AC=20
tion never arose from the urge of the innermost heart, but from=20
the compulsion of circumstances. However, the German people=20
of the old Ostmark were swept along by the Reich=E2=80=99s frenzy of=20
victory, and looked on with deep emotion as the dream of their=20
fathers was resurrected to glorious reality.=20

For make no mistake: the truly German-minded Austrian had,=20
even at Kbniggratz, 1 and from this time on, recognized the tragic=20
but necessary prerequisite for the resurrection of a Reich which=20
would no longer be =E2=80=94 and actually was not =E2=80=94 afflicted with =

But when after the great war the House of Habsburg began=20

but rebels against a kind of government which in their conviction=20
would inevitably lead to the destruction of their own nationality.=20

For the first time in modern German history, traditional dy=C2=AC=20

that a state authority is entitled to demand respect and protection=20
only when it meets the interests of a people, or at least does not=20

by=20
theoretical dissertations, but by force and =E2=80=94 results.=20

Since, as a matter of course, all governmental power claims the=20

=20
betraying the interests of a people a thousandfold =E2=80=94- the national=

but it will not shun illegal means if the oppressor uses them.=20

In general it should not be forgotten that the highest aim of=20
human existence is not the preservation of a state, let alone a=20
government, but the preservation of the species.=20

And if the species itself is in danger of being oppressed or ut=C2=AC=20

so-called =E2=80=98 legality =E2=80=99 is shown most clearly and penetratin=
gly by the=20
example of Austria.=20

The legal state power in those days was rooted in the anti-=20
German soil of parliament with its non-German majorities =E2=80=94=20
and in the equally anti-German ruling house. In these two factors=20
the entire state authority was embodied. Any attempt to change=20
the destinies of the German-Austrian people from this position=20
was absurd. Hence, in the opinions of our friends the worshipers=20
of state authority as such and of the =E2=80=98legal=E2=80=99 way, all resi=
stance=20
would have had to be shunned, as incompatible with legal=20
methods. But this, with compelling necessity, would have meant=20
the end of the German people in the monarchy =E2=80=94 and in a very=20
short time. And, as a matter of fact, the Germans were saved=20
from this fate only by the collapse of this state.=20

The bespectacled theoretician, it is true, would still prefer to=20
die for his doctrine than for his people.=20

Since it is men who make the laws, he believes that they live=20
for the sake of these laws.=20

The Pan-German movement in Austria had the merit of com=C2=AC=20
pletely doing away with this nonsense, to the horror of all theo=C2=AC=20
retical pedants and other fetish-worshiping isolationists in the=20
government.=20

Since the Habsburgs attempted to attack Germanism with all=20
possible means, this party attacked the =E2=80=98exalted=E2=80=99 ruling ho=
use=20
itself, and without mercy. For the first time it probed into this=20
rotten state and opened the eyes of hundreds of thousands. To=20
its credit be it said that it released the glorious concept of love of=20
fatherland from the embrace of this sorry dynasty.=20

In the early days of its appearance, its following was extremely=20
great, threatening to become a veritable avalanche. But the suc=C2=AC=20
cess did not last. When I came to Vienna, the movement had long=20
been overshadowed by the Christian Social Party which had=20
meanwhile attained power =E2=80=94 and had indeed been reduced to=20
almost complete insignificance.=20

This whole process of the growth and passing of the Pan-=20


98=20


Mein Kampf=20


German movement on the one hand, and the unprecedented rise=20
of the Christian Social Party on the other, was to assume the=20
deepest significance for me as a classical object of study.=20

When I came to Vienna, my sympathies were fully and wholly=20
on the side of the Pan-German tendency.=20

That they mustered the courage to cry =E2=80=98Hoch Hohenzollern=E2=80=99=
=20
impressed me as much as it pleased me; that they still regarded=20
themselves as an only temporarily severed part of the German=20
Reich, and never let a moment pass without openly attesting this=20
fact, inspired me with joyful confidence; that in all questions re=C2=AC=20
garding Germanism they showed their colors without reserve, and=20
never descended to compromises, seemed to me the one still=20
passable road to the salvation of our people; and I could not=20
understand how after its so magnificent rise the movement should=20
have taken such a sharp decline. Even less could I understand=20
how the Christian Social Party at this same period could achieve=20
such immense power. At that time it had just reached the apogee=20
of its glory.=20

As I set about comparing these movements, Fate, accelerated=20
by my otherwise sad situation, gave me the best instruction for=20
an understanding of the causes of this riddle.=20

I shall begin my comparisons with the two men who may be=20
regarded as the leaders and founders of the two parties: Georg=20
von Schonerer and Dr. Karl Lueger.=20

From a purely human standpoint they both tower far above=20
the scope and stature of so-called parliamentary figures. Amid=20
the morass of general political corruption their whole life re=C2=AC=20
mained pure and unassailable. Nevertheless my personal sym=C2=AC=20
pathy lay at first on the side of the Pan-German Schonerer, and=20
turned only little by little toward the Christian Social leader as=20
well.=20

Compared as to abilities, Schonerer seemed to me even then the=20
better and more profound thinker in questions of principle. He=20
foresaw the inevitable end of the Austrian state more clearly and=20
correctly than anyone else. If, especially in the Reich, people had=20
paid more attention to his warnings against the Habsburg mon-=20


SCHONERER AND LUEGER=20


99=20


archy, the calamity of Germany=E2=80=99s World War against all Europe=20
would never have occurred.=20

But if Schonerer recognized the problems in their innermost=20
essence, he erred when it came to men.=20

Here, on the other hand, lay Dr. Lueger=E2=80=99s strength.=20

He had a rare knowledge of men and in particular took good=20
care not to consider people better than they are. Consequently,=20
he reckoned more with the real possibilities of life while Schonerer=20
had but little understanding for them. Theoretically speaking,=20
all the Pan-German=E2=80=99s thoughts were correct, but since he lacked=20
the force and astuteness to transmit his theoretical knowledge to=20
the masses =E2=80=94 that is, to put it in a form suited to the receptivity=
=20
of the broad masses, which is and remains exceedingly limited =E2=80=94=20
all his knowledge was visionary wisdom, and could never become=20
practical reality.=20

And this lack of actual knowledge of men led in the course of=20
time to an error in estimating the strength of whole movements=20
as well as age-old institutions.=20

Finally, Schonerer realized, to be sure, that questions of basic=20
philosophy were involved, but he did not understand that only=20
the broad masses of a people are primarily able to uphold such=20
well-nigh religious convictions.=20

Unfortunately, he saw only to a limited extent the extra=C2=AC=20
ordinary limitation of the will to fight in so-called =E2=80=98 bourgeois=
=E2=80=99=20
circles, due, if nothing else, to their economic position which=20
makes the individual fear to lose too much and thereby holds him=20
in check.=20

And yet, on the whole, a philosophy can hope for victory only=20
if the broad masses adhere to the new doctrine and declare their=20
readiness to undertake the necessary struggle.=20

From this deficient understanding of the importance of the=20
lower strata of the people arose a completely inadequate con=C2=AC=20
ception of the social question.=20

In all this Dr. Lueger was the opposite of Schonerer.=20

His thorough knowledge of men enabled him to judge the=20
possible forces correctly, at the same time preserving him from=20


100=20


Mein Kampe=20


underestimating existing institutions, and perhaps for this very=20
reason taught him to make use of these institutions as instru=C2=AC=20
ments for the achievement of his purposes.=20

He understood only too well that the political fighting power=20
of the upper bourgeoisie at the present time was but slight and=20
inadequate for achieving the victory of a great movement. He=20
therefore laid the greatest stress in his political activity on=20
winning over the classes whose existence was threatened and=20
therefore tended to spur rather than paralyze the will to fight.=20
Likewise he was inclined to make use of all existing implements=20
of power, to incline mighty existing institutions in his favor,=20
drawing from these old sources of power the greatest possible=20
profit for his own movement.=20

Thus he adjusted his new party primarily to the middle class=20
menaced with destruction, and thereby assured himself of a fol=C2=AC=20
lowing that was difficult to shake, whose spirit of sacrifice was as=20
great as its fighting power. His policy toward the Catholic=20
Church, fashioned with infinite shrewdness, in a short time won=20
over the younger clergy to such an extent that the old Clerical=20
Party was forced either to abandon the field, or, more wisely, to=20
join the new party, in order slowly to recover position after=20
position.=20

To take this alone as the characteristic essence of the man=20
would be to do him a grave injustice. For in addition to being=20
an astute tactician, he had the qualities of a truly great and=20
brilliant reformer: though here, too, he observed the limits set by=20
a precise knowledge of the existing possibilities as well as his own=20
personal abilities.=20

It was an infinitely practical goal that this truly significant=20
man had set himself. He wanted to conquer Vienna. Vienna was=20
the heart of the monarchy; from this city the last flush of life=20
flowed out into the sickly, old body of the crumbling empire.=20
The healthier the heart became, the more the rest of the body was=20
bound to revive: an idea, correct in principle, but which could be=20
applied only for a certain limited time.=20

And herein lay this man=E2=80=99s weakness.=20


Causes of Schonerer=E2=80=99s Failure=20


101=20


What he had done as mayor of Vienna is immortal in the best=20
sense of the word; 1 but he could no longer save the monarchy, it=20
was too late.=20

His opponent, Schonerer, had seen this more clearly.=20

All Dr. Lueger=E2=80=99s practical efforts were amazingly successful;=20
the hopes he based on them were not realized.=20

Schonerer=E2=80=99s efforts were not successful, but his most terrible=20
fears came true.=20

Thus neither man realized his ultimate goal. Lueger could no=20
longer save Austria, and Schonerer could no longer save the=20
German people from ruin.=20

It is infinitely instructive for our present day to study the=20
causes for the failure of both parties. This is particularly useful=20
for my friends, since in many points conditions today are similar=20
to then and errors can thereby be avoided which at that time=20
caused the end of the one movement and the sterility of the other.=20

To my mind, there were three causes for the collapse of the=20
Pan-German movement in Austria.=20

In the first place, its unclear conception of the significance of=20
the social problem, especially for a new and essentially revolution=C2=AC=
=20
ary party.=20

Since Schonerer and his followers addressed themselves princi=C2=AC=20
pally to bourgeois circles, the result was bound to be very feeble=20
and tame.=20

Though some people fail to suspect it, the German bourgeoisie,=20
especially in its upper circles, is pacifistic to the point of positive=20
self-abnegation, where internal affairs of the nation or state are=20
concerned. In good times =E2=80=94 that is, in this case, in times of good=
=20
government =E2=80=94 such an attitude makes these classes extremely=20
valuable to the state; but in times of an inferior regime it is pos=C2=AC=
=20
itively ruinous. To make possible the waging of any really serious=20
struggle, the Pan-German movement should above all have=20
dedicated itself to winning the masses. That it failed to do so=20
deprived it in advance of the elemental impetus which a wave of=20
its kind simply must have if it is not in a short time to ebb away.=20

1 *unsierblich im besten Sinne des Wortesd=20


102=20


Mein Kampf=20


Unless this principle is borne in mind and carried out from the=20
very start, the new party loses all possibility of later making up=20
for what has been lost. For, by the admission of numerous mod=C2=AC=20
erate bourgeois elements, the basic attitude of the movement will=20
always be governed by them and thus lose any further prospect=20
of winning appreciable forces from the broad masses. As a result,=20
such a movement will not rise above mere grumbling and criticiz=C2=AC=20
ing. The faith bordering more or less on religion, combined with=20
a similar spirit of sacrifice, will cease to exist; in its place will arise=
=20
an effort gradually to grind off the edges of struggle by means of=20
=E2=80=98positive=E2=80=99 collaboration; that is, in this case, by accepta=
nce of the=20
existing order, thus ultimately leading to a putrid peace.=20

And this is what happened to the Pan-German movement be=C2=AC=20
cause it had not from the outset laid its chief stress on winning=20
supporters from the circles of the great masses. It achieved=20
=E2=80=98bourgeois respectability and a muffled radicalism.=E2=80=99=20

From this error arose the second cause of its rapid decline.=20

At the time of the emergence of the Pan-German movement=20
the situation of the Germans in Austria was already desperate.=20
From year to year the parliament had increasingly become an=20
institution for the slow destruction of the German people. Any=20
attempt at salvation in the eleventh hour could offer even the=20
slightest hope of success only if this institution were eliminated.=20

Thus the movement was faced with a question of basic im=C2=AC=20
portance :=20

Should its members, to destroy parliament, go into parliament,=20
in order, as people used to say, =E2=80=98to bore from within,=E2=80=99 or =
should=20
they carry on the struggle from outside by an attack on this in=C2=AC=20
stitution as such?=20

They went in and they came out defeated.=20

To be sure, they couldn=E2=80=99t help but go in.=20

To carry on the struggle against such a power from outside=20
means to arm with unflinching courage and to be prepared for=20
endless sacrifices. You seize the bull by the horns, you suffer=20
many heavy blows, you are sometimes thrown to the earth, some=C2=AC=20
times you get up with broken limbs, and only after the hardest=20


Pan-Germans and Parliament=20


103=20


contest does victory reward the bold assailant. Only the greatness=20
of the sacrifices will win new fighters for the cause, until at last=20
tenacity is rewarded by success.=20

But for this the sons of the broad masses are required.=20

They alone are determined and tough enough to carry through=20
the fight to its bloody end.=20

And the Pan-German movement did not possess these broad=20
masses; thus no course remained open but to go into parliament.=20

It would be a mistake to believe that this decision was the re=C2=AC=20
sult of long soul torments, or even meditations; no, no other idea=20
entered their heads. Participation in this absurdity was only the=20
sediment resulting from general, unclear conceptions regarding=20
the significance and effect of such a^participation in an institution=20
which had in principle been recognized as false. In general, the=20
party hoped that this would facilitate the enlightenment of the=20
broad masses, since it would now have an opportunity to speak=20
before the =E2=80=98forum of the whole nation.=E2=80=99 Besides, it seemed =
plaus=C2=AC=20
ible that attacking the root of the evil was bound to be more=20
successful than storming it from outside. They thought the se=C2=AC=20
curity of the individual fighter was increased by the protection=20
of parliamentary immunity, and that this could only enhance the=20
force of the attack.=20

In reality, it must be said, things turned out very differently.=20

The forum before which the Pan-German deputies spoke had=20
not become greater but smaller; for each man speaks only to the=20
circle which can hear him, or which obtains an account of his=20
words in the newspapers.=20

And, not the halls of parliament, but the great public meeting,=20
represents the largest direct forum of listeners.=20

For, in the latter, there are thousands of people who have come=20
only to hear what the speaker has to say to them, while in the=20
halls of parliament there are only a few hundreds, and most of=20
these are present only to collect their attendance fees, and cer=C2=AC=20
tainly not to be illuminated by the wisdom of this or that fellow=20
=E2=80=98representative of the people/=20

And above all:=20


104=20


Mein Kampf=20


This is always the same public, which will never learn anything=20
new, since, aside from the intelligence, it is lacking in the very=20
rudiments of will.=20

Never will one of these representatives of the people honor a=20
superior truth of his own accord, and place himself in its service.=20

No, this is something that not a single one of them will do un=C2=AC=20
less he has reason to hope that by such a shift he may save his=20
mandate for one more session. Only when it is in the air that the=20
party in power will come off badly in a coming election, will these=20
ornaments of virility shift to a party or tendency which they=20
presume will come out better, though you may be confident that=20
this change of position usually occurs amidst a cloudburst of=20
moral justifications. Consequently, when an existing party ap=C2=AC=20
pears to be falling beneath the disfavor of the people to such an=20
extent that the probability of an annihilating defeat threatens,=20
such a great shift will always begin: then the parliamentary rats=20
leave the party ship.=20

All this has nothing to do with better knowledge or intentions,=20
but only with that prophetic gift which warns these parliamentary=20
bedbugs at the right moment and causes them to drop, again and=20
again, into another warm party bed.=20

But to speak to such a 1 forum =E2=80=99 is really to cast pearls before th=
e=20
well-known domestic beasts. It is truly not worth while. The=20
result can be nothing but zero.=20

And that is just what it was.=20

The Pan-German deputies could talk their throats hoarse: the=20
effect was practically nil.=20

The press either killed them with silence or mutilated their=20
speeches in such a way that any coherence, and often even the=20
sense, was twisted or entirely lost, and public opinion received a=20
very poor picture of the aims of the new movement. What the=20
various gentlemen said was quite unimportant; the important=20
thing was what people read about them. And this was an extract=20
from their speeches, so disjointed that it could =E2=80=94 as intended =E2=
=80=94=20
only seem absurd. The only forum to which they really spoke con=C2=AC=20
sisted of five hundred parliamentarians, and that is enough said.=20


Pan-Germans and Parliament=20


105=20


But the worst was the following:=20

The Pan-German movement could count on success only if it=20
realized from the very first day that what was required was not a=20
new party, but a new philosophy. Only the latter could produce=20
the inward power to fight this gigantic struggle to its end. And=20
for this, only the very best and courageous minds can serve as=20
leaders.=20

If the struggle for a philosophy is not lead by heroes prepared=20
to make sacrifices, there will, in a short time, cease to be any=20
warriors willing to die. The man who is fighting for his own=20
existence cannot have much left over for the community.=20

In order to maintain this requirement, every man must know=20
that the new movement can offer the present nothing but honor=20
and fame in posterity . 1 The more easily attainable posts and=20
offices a movement has to hand out, the more inferior stuff 2 it=20
will attract, and in the end these political hangers-on overwhelm=20
a successful party in such number that the honest fighter of=20
former days no longer recognizes the old movement and the new=20
arrivals definitely reject him as an unwelcome intruder. When=20
this happens, the =E2=80=98 mission=E2=80=99 of such a movement is done for=
.=20

As soon as the Pan-German movement sold its soul to parlia=C2=AC=20
ment, it attracted =E2=80=98parliamentarians=E2=80=99 instead of leaders an=
d=20
fighters.=20

Thus it sank to the level of the ordinary political parties of the=20
day and lost the strength to oppose a catastrophic destiny with=20
the defiance of martyrdom. Instead of fighting, it now learned to=20
make speeches and =E2=80=98negotiate.=E2=80=99 And in a short time the new=
=20
parliamentarian found it a more attractive, because less danger=C2=AC=20

necessary, by throwing himself into a struggle whose issue was=20
uncertain and which in any case could bring him no profit.=20

Once they had members in parliament, the supporters outside=20
began to hope and wait for miracles which, of course, did not=20
occur and could not occur. For this reason they soon became=20
impatient, for even what they heard from their own deputies was=20
by no means up to the expectations of the voters. This was per=C2=AC=20
fectly natural, since the hostile press took good care not to give=20
the people any faithful picture of the work of the Pan-German=20
deputies.=20

The more the new representatives of the people developed a=20
taste for the somewhat gentler variety of =E2=80=98revolutionary=E2=80=99 s=
truggle=20
in parliament and the provincial diets, the less prepared they were=20
to return to the more dangerous work of enlightening the broad=20
masses of the people.=20

The mass meeting, the only way to exert a truly effective, be=C2=AC=20
cause personal, influence on large sections of the people and thus=20
possibly to win them, was thrust more and more into the back=C2=AC=20
ground.=20

Once the platform of parliament was definitely substituted for=20
the beer table of the meeting hall, and from this forum speeches=20
were poured, not into the people, but on the heads of their so-=20
called =E2=80=98elect/ the Pan-German movement ceased to be a move=C2=AC=20
ment of the people and in a short time dwindled into an academic=20
discussion club to be taken more or less seriously.=20

Consequently, the bad impression transmitted by the press=20
was in no way corrected by personal agitation at meetings by the=20
individual gentlemen, with the result that finally the word =E2=80=98Pan-=
=20
German =E2=80=99 began to have a very bad sound in the ears of the broad=20
masses.=20

For let it be said to all our present-day fops and knights of the=20
pen: the greatest revolutions in this world have never been di=C2=AC=20
rected by a goose-quill!=20

No, to the pen it has always been reserved to provide their=20
theoretical foundations.=20

But the power which has always started the greatest religious=20


The Importance of the Spoken Word=20


107=20


and political avalanches in history rolling has from time im=C2=AC=20
memorial been the magic power of the spoken word, and that=20
alone.=20

Particularly the broad masses of the people can be moved only=20
by the power of speech. And all great movements are popular=20
movements, volcanic eruptions of human passions and emotional=20
sentiments, stirred either by the cruel Goddess of Distress or by=20
the firebrand of the word hurled among the masses; they are not=20
the lemonade-like outpourings of literary aesthetes and drawing=C2=AC=20
room heroes.=20

Only a storm of hot passion can turn the destinies of peoples,=20
and he alone can arouse passion who bears it within himself.=20

It alone gives its chosen one the words which like hammer=20
blows can open the gates to the heart of a people.=20

But the man whom passion fails and whose lips are sealed =E2=80=94=20
he has not been chosen by Heaven to proclaim its will.=20

Therefore, let the writer remain by his ink-well, engaging in=20
Theoretical=E2=80=99 activity, if his intelligence and ability are equal to=
=20
it; for leadership he is neither born nor chosen.=20

A movement with great aims must therefore be anxiously on=20
its guard not to lose contact with the broad masses.=20

It must examine every question primarily from this standpoint=20
and make its decisions accordingly.=20

It must, furthermore, avoid everything which might diminish=20
or even weaken its ability to move the masses, not for =E2=80=98 demagogic =
=E2=80=99=20
reasons, but in the simple knowledge that without the mighty=20
force of the mass of a people, no great idea, however lofty and=20
noble it may seem, can be realized.=20

Hard reality alone must determine the road to the goal; un=C2=AC=20
willingness to travel unpleasant roads only too often in this=20
world means to renounce the goal; which may or may not be=20
what you want.=20

As soon as the Pan-German movement by its parliamentary=20
attitude had shifted the weight of its activity to parliament in=C2=AC=20
stead of the people, it lost the future and instead won cheap suc=C2=AC=20
cesses of the moment.=20


108=20


Mein Kampf=20


It chose the easier struggle and thereby became unworthy of=20
ultimate victory.=20

Even in Vienna I pondered this very question with the greatest=20
care, and in the failure to recognize it saw one of the main causes=20
of the collapse of the movement which in those days, in my opin=C2=AC=20
ion, was predestined to undertake the leadership of the German=20
element.=20

The first two mistakes which caused the Pan-German move=C2=AC=20
ment to founder were related to each other. Insufficient know=C2=AC=20
ledge of the inner driving forces of great revolutions led to an=20
insufficient estimation of the importance of the broad masses of=20
the people; from this resulted its insufficient interest in the social=20
question, its deficient and inadequate efforts to win the soul of=20
the lower classes of the nation, as well as its over-favorable atti=C2=AC=
=20
tude toward parliament.=20

If they had recognized the tremendous power which at all=20
times must be attributed to the masses as the repository of rev=C2=AC=20
olutionary resistance, they would have worked differently in=20
social and propagandist matters. Then the movement=E2=80=99s center=20
of gravity would not have been shifted to parliament, but to the=20
workshop and the street.=20

Likewise the third error finds its ultimate germ in failure to=20
recognize the value of the masses, which, it is true, need superior=20
minds to set them in motion in a given direction, but which then,=20
like a flywheel, lend the force of the attack momentum and uni=C2=AC=20
form persistence.=20

The hard struggle which the Pan-Germans fought with the=20
Catholic Church can be accounted for only by their insufficient=20
understanding of the spiritual nature of the people.=20

The causes for the new party=E2=80=99s violent attack on Rome were=20
as follows:=20

As soon as the House of Habsburg had definitely made up its=20
mind to reshape Austria into a Slavic state, it seized upon every=20
means which seemed in any way suited to this tendency. Even=20
religious institutions were, without the slightest qualms, har=C2=AC=20
nessed to the service of the new =E2=80=98state idea=E2=80=99 by this unscr=
upulous=20
ruling house.=20


The =E2=80=98 Away-from-Rome 9 Movement=20


109=20


The use of Czech pastorates and their spiritual shepherds was=20
but one of the many means of attaining this goal, a general=20
Slavization of Austria.=20

The process took approximately the following form:=20

Czech pastors were appointed to German communities; slowly=20
but surely they began to set the interests of the Czech people=20
above the interests of the churches, becoming germ-cells of the=20
de-Germanization process.=20

The German clergy did practically nothing to counter these=20
methods. Not only were they completely useless for carrying on=20
this struggle in a positive German sense; they were even unable=20
to oppose the necessary resistance to the attacks of the adversary.=20
Indirectly, by the misuse of religion on the one hand, and owing=20
to insufficient defense on the other, Germanism was slowly but=20
steadily forced back.=20

If in small matters the situation was as described, in big things,=20
unfortunately, it was not far different.=20

Here, too, the anti-German efforts of the Habsburgs did not=20
encounter the resistance they should have, especially on the part=20
of the high clergy, while the defense of German interests sank=20
completely into the background.=20

The general impression could only be that the Catholic clergy=20
as such was grossly infringing on German rights.=20

Thus the Church did not seem to feel with the German people,=20
but to side unjustly with the enemy. The root of the whole evil=20
lay, particularly in Schonerer=E2=80=99s opinion, in the fact that the di=
=C2=AC=20
recting body of the Catholic Church was not in Germany ; and=20
that for this very reason alone it was hostile to the interests of our=20
nationality.=20

The so-called cultural problems, in this as in virtually every=20
other connection in Austria at that time, were relegated almost=20
entirely to the background. The attitude of the Pan-German=20
movement toward the Catholic Church was determined far less=20
by its position on science, etc., than by its inadequacy in the=20
championing of German rights and, conversely, its continued aid=20
and comfort to Slavic arrogance and greed.=20


110=20


Mein Kampf=20


Georg Schonerer was not the man to do things by halves. He=20
took up the struggle toward the Church in the conviction that by=20
it alone he could save the German people. The =E2=80=98Away-from-=20
Rome =E2=80=99 1 movement seemed the most powerful, though, to be=20
sure, the most difficult, mode of attack, which would inevitably=20
shatter the hostile citadel. If it was successful, the tragic church=20
schism in Germany would be healed, and it was possible that the=20
inner strength of the Empire and the German nation would gain=20
enormously by such a victory.=20

But neither the premise nor the inference of this struggle was=20
correct.=20

Without doubt the national force of resistance of the Catholic=20
clergy of German nationality, in all questions connected with=20
Germanism, was less than that of their non-German, particularly=20
Czech, brethren.=20

Likewise only an ignoramus could fail to see that an offensive=20
in favor of German interests was something that practically never=20
occurred to the German clergyman.=20

And anyone who was not blind was forced equally-to admit=20
that this was due primarily to a circumstance under which all of=20
us Germans have to suffer severely: that is, the objectivity of=20
our attitude toward our nationality as well as everything else.=20

While the Czech clergyman was subjective in his attitude to=C2=AC=20
ward his people and objective only toward the Church, the Ger=C2=AC=20
man pastor was subjectively devoted to the Church and remained=20
objective toward the nation. A phenomenon which, to our mis=C2=AC=20
fortune, we can observe equally well in thousands of other cases.=20

This is by no means a special legacy of Catholicism, but with=20
us it quickly corrodes almost every institution, whether it be=20
governmental or ideal.=20

Just compare the position which our civil servants, for example,=20
take toward the attempts at a national awakening with the posi=C2=AC=20
tion which in such a case the civil servants of another people=20
would take. Or does anyone believe that an officers=E2=80=99 corps any=C2=

nation amid mouthings about =E2=80=98 state authority/ in the way that=20
has been taken for granted in our country for the last five years,=20
in fact, has been viewed as especially meritorious? In the Jewish=20
question, tor example, do not both denominations today take a=20
standpoint which corresponds neither to the requirements of the=20
nation nor to the real needs of religion? Compare the attitude of=20
a Jewish rabbi in all questions of even the slightest importance=20
for the Jews as a race with the attitude of by far the greatest part=20
of our clergy =E2=80=94 of both denominations, if you please!=20

We always find this phenomenon when it is a question of de=C2=AC=20
fending an abstract idea as such.=20

=E2=80=98State authority/ =E2=80=98democracy/ =E2=80=98pacifism/ =E2=80=98i=
nternational soli=C2=AC=20
darity/ etc., are all concepts which with us nearly always be=C2=AC=20
come so rigid and purely doctrinaire that subsequently all purely=20
national vital necessities are judged exclusively from their stand=C2=AC=20
point.=20

This catastrophic way of considering all matters from the angle=20
of a preconceived opinion kills every possibility of thinking one=C2=AC=20
self subjectively into a matter which is objectively opposed to=20
one=E2=80=99s own doctrine, and finally leads to a total reversal of means=
=20
and ends. People will reject any attempt at a national uprising=20
if it can take place only after the elimination of a bad, ruinous=20
regime, since this would be an offense against =E2=80=98state authority/=20
and =E2=80=98state authority=E2=80=99 is not a means to an end, but in the =
eyes of=20
such a fanatical objectivist rather represents the aim itself, which=20
is sufficient to fill out his whole lamentable life. Thus, for ex=C2=AC=20
ample, they would indignantly oppose any attempt at a dictator=C2=AC=20
ship, even if it was represented by a Frederick the Great and the=20
momentary political comedians of a parliamentary majority=20
were incapable dwarfs or really inferior characters, just because=20
the law of democracy seems holier to such a principle-monger 1=20
than the welfare of a nation. The one will therefore defend the=20
worst tyranny, a tyranny which is ruining the people, since at=20

his conception of =E2=80=98 democracy.=E2=80=99=20

In exactly the same way, our German pacifist will accept in=20
silence the bloodiest rape of our nation at the hands of the most=20
vicious military powers if a change in this state of affairs can be=20
achieved only by resistance =E2=80=94 that is, force =E2=80=94 for this wou=
ld be=20
contrary to the spirit of his peace society. Let the international=20
German Socialist be plundered in solidarity by the rest of the=20
world, he will accept it with brotherly affection and no thought=20
of retribution or even defense, just because he is =E2=80=94 a German.=20

This may be a sad state of affairs, but to change a thing means=20
to recognize it first.=20

The same is true of the weak defense of German interests by a=20
part of the clergy.=20

It is neither malicious ill will in itself, nor is it caused, let us=20
say, by commands from =E2=80=98above=E2=80=99; no, in such a lack of nation=
al=20
determination we see merely the result of an inadequate educa=C2=AC=20
tion in Germanism from childhood up and, on the other hand, an=20
unlimited submission to an idea which has become an idol.=20

Education in democracy, in socialism of the international=20
variety, in pacifism, etc., is a thing so rigid and exclusive, so=20
purely subjective from these points of view, that the general=20
picture of the remaining world is colored by this dogmatic con=C2=AC=20
ception, while the attitude toward Germanism has remained ex=C2=AC=20
ceedingly objective from early youth. Thus, the pacifist, by giv=C2=AC=20
ing himself subjectively and entirely to his idea, will, in the=20
presence of any menace to his people, be it ever so grave and un=C2=AC=20
just, always (in so far as he is a German) seek after the objective=20
right and never from pure instinct of self-preservation join the=20
ranks of his herd and fight with them.=20

To what extent this is also true of the different religions is=20
shown by the following:=20

Protestantism as such is a better defender of the interests of=20
Germanism, in so far as this is grounded in its genesis and later=20
tradition; it fails, however, in the moment when this defense of=20


The =E2=80=98 Away-erom-Rome =E2=80=99 Movement=20


113=20


national interests must take place in a province which is either=20
absent from the general line of its ideological world and tradi=C2=AC=20
tional development, or is for some reason rejected.=20

Thus, Protestantism will always stand up for the advancement=20
of all Germanism as such, as long as matters of inner purity or=20
national deepening 1 as well as German freedom are involved,=20
since all these things have a firm foundation in its own being; but=20
it combats with the greatest hostility any attempt to rescue the=20
nation from the embrace of its most mortal enemy, since its at=C2=AC=20
titude toward the Jews just happens to be more or less dogmati=C2=AC=20
cally established. Yet here we are facing the question without=20
whose solution all other attempts at a German reawakening or=20
resurrection are and remain absolutely senseless and impossible.=20

In my Vienna period I had leisure and opportunity enough for=20
an unprejudiced examination of this question too, and in my daily=20
contacts was able to establish the correctness of this view a=20
thousand times over.=20

In this focus of the most varied nationalities, it immediately=20
becomes clearly apparent that the German pacifist is alone in=20
always attempting to view the interests of his own nation ob=C2=AC=20
jectively, but that the Jew will never regard those of the Jewish=20
people in this way;'that only the German Socialist is =E2=80=98 interna=C2=
=AC=20
tional =E2=80=99 in a sense which forbids him to beg mstice for his own=20
people except by whimpering and whining in the midst of his=20
international comrades, but never a Czech or a Pole, etc.; in=20
short, I recognized even then that the misfortune lies only partly=20
in these doctrines, and partly in our totally inadequate education=20
in national sentiment and a resultant lack of devotion to our=20
nation.=20

Thus, the first theoretical foundation for a struggle of the Pan-=20
German movement against Catholicism as such was lacking.=20

Let the German people be raised from childhood up with that=20
exclusive recognition of the rights of their own nationality, and=20
let not the hearts of children be contaminated with the curse of=20
our =E2=80=98objectivity/ even in matters regarding the preservation of=20

their own ego. Then in a short time it will be seen that (presup=C2=AC=20
posing, of course, a radically national government) in Germany,=20
as in Ireland, Poland, or France, the Catholic will always be a=20
German.=20

The mightiest proof of this was provided by that epoch which=20
for the last time led our nation into a life-and-death struggle=20
before the judgment seat of history in defense of its own existence.=20

As long as leadership from above was not lacking, the people=20
fulfilled their duty and obligation overwhelmingly. Whether=20
Protestant pastor or Catholic priest, both together contributed=20
infinitely in maintaining for so long our power to resist, not only=20
at the front but also at home. In these years and particularly at=20
the first flare, there really existed in both camps but a single holy=20
German Reich, for whose existence and future each man turned=20
to his own heaven.=20

The Pan-German movement in Austria should have asked it=C2=AC=20
self one question: Is the preservation of German-Austrianism=20
possible under a Catholic faith, or is it not? If yes, the political=20
party had no right to concern itself with religious or denomi=C2=AC=20
national matters; if not, then what was needed was a religious=20
reformation and never a political party.=20

Anyone who thinks he can arrive at a religious reformation by=20
the detour of a political organization only shows that he has no=20
glimmer of knowledge of the development of religious ideas or=20
dogmas and their ecclesiastical consequences.=20

Verily a man cannot serve two masters. And I consider the=20
foundation or destruction of a religion far greater than the=20
foundation or destruction of a state, let alone a party.=20

And let it not be said that this 1 is only a defense against the=20
attacks from the other side!=20

It is certain that at all times unscrupulous scoundrels have not=20
shunned to make even religion the instrument of their political=20
bargains (for that is what such rabble almost always and ex=C2=AC=20
clusively deal in): but just as certainly it is wrong to make a re=C2=AC=20

Nothing can better suit one of these parliamentarian good-for-=20
nothings and lounge-lizards than when an opportunity is offered=20
to justify his political swindling, even after the fact.=20

For as soon as religion or even denomination is made responsi=C2=AC=20
ble for his personal vices and attacked on that ground, this shame=C2=AC=20
less liar sets up a great outcry and calls the whole world to witness=20
that his behavior has been completely justified and that he alone=20
and his eloquence are to be thanked for saving religion of the=20
Church. The public, as stupid as it is forgetful, is, as a rule, pre=C2=AC=
=20
vented by the very outcry from recognizing the real instigator of=20
the struggle or else has forgotten him, and the scoundrel has to all=20
intents and purposes achieved his goal.=20

The sly fox knows perfectly well that this has nothing to do=20
with religion; and he will silently laugh up his sleeve while his=20
honest but clumsy opponent loses the game and one day, despair=C2=AC=20
ing of the loyalty and faith of humanity, withdraws from it all.=20

And in another sense it would be unjust to make religion as=20
such or even the Church responsible for the failings of individuals.=20
Compare the greatness of the visible organization before our eyes=20
with the average fallibility of man in general, and you will have=20
to admit that in it the relation of good and evil is better than=20
anywhere else. To be sure, even among the priests themselves=20
there are those to whom their holy office is only a means of satis=C2=AC=20
fying their political ambition, yes, who in political struggle for=C2=AC=20
get, in a fashion which is often more than deplorable that they=20
are supposed to be the guardians of a higher truth and not the=20
representatives of lies and slander =E2=80=94 but for one such unworthy=20
priest there are a thousand and more honorable ones, shepherds=20
most loyally devoted to their mission, who, in our present false=20
and decadent period, stand out of the general morass like little=20

No more than I condemn, or would be justified in condemning,=20

one of the many others besmirches and betrays his nationality=20
at a time when this is a daily occurrence anyway. Particularly=20
today, we must not forget that for one such Ephialtes there are=20
thousands who with bleeding heart feel the misfortune of their=20
people and like the best of our nation long for the hour in which=20
Heaven will smile on us again.=20

And if anyone replies that here we are not concerned with such=20
everyday problems, but with questions of principle and truth or=20
dogmatic content, we can aptly counter with another question :=20

If you believe that you have been chosen by Fate to reveal the=20
truth in this matter, do so; but then have the courage to do so,=20
not indirectly through a political party =E2=80=94 for this is a swindle;=
=20

But if you lack courage, or if your good is not quite clear even=20
to yourself, then keep your fingers out of the matter; in any case,=20
do not attempt by roundabout sneaking through a political move=C2=AC=20
ment to do what you dare not do with an open vizor.=20

Political parties have nothing to do with religious problems,=20
as long as these are not alien to the nation, undermining the=20
morals and ethics of the race; just as religion cannot be amal=C2=AC=20
gamated with the scheming of political parties.=20

When Church dignitaries make use of religious institutions or=20
doctrines to injure their nation, we must never follow them on=20
this path and fight with the same methods.=20

For the political leader the religious doctrines and institutions of=20
his people must always remain inviolable; or else he has no right to=20
be in politics , but should become a reformer , if he has what it takesl=20

Especially in Germany any other attitude would lead to a=20
catastrophe.=20

In my study of the Pan-German movement and its struggle=20
against Rome, I then, and even more in the years to come, ar=C2=AC=20
rived at the following conviction: This movement=E2=80=99s inadequate=20
appreciation of the importance of the social problem cost it the=20
truly militant mass of the people; its entry into parliament took=20
away its mighty impetus and burdened it with all the weaknesses=20
peculiar to this institution; the struggle against the Catholic=20


Concentration on the Enemy=20


117=20


Church made it impossible in numerous small and middle circles,=20
and thus robbed it of countless of the best elements that the na=C2=AC=20
tion can call its own.=20

The practical result of the Austrian Kulturkampf 1 was next to=20
nil.=20

To be sure, it succeeded in tearing some hundred thousand=20
members away from the Church, yet without causing it any=20
particular damage. In this case the Church really had no need=20
to shed tears over the lost =E2=80=98 lambs 5 ; for it lost only those who =
had=20
long ceased to belong to it. The difference between the new ref=C2=AC=20
ormation and the old one was that in the old days many of the=20
best people in the Church turned away from it through profound=20
religious conviction, while now only those who were lukewarm to=20
begin with departed, and this from =E2=80=98 considerations 5 of a politica=
l=20
nature.=20

And precisely from the political standpoint the result was just=20
as laughable as it was sad.=20

*=20

Once again a promising political movement for the salvation=20
of the German nation had gone to the dogs because it had not been=20
led with the necessary cold ruthlessness, but had lost itself in=20
fields which could only lead to disintegration.=20

For one thing is assuredly true:=20

The Pan-German movement would never have made this mis=C2=AC=20
take but for its insufficient understanding of the psyche of the=20
broad masses. If its leaders had known that to achieve any suc=C2=AC=20
cess one should, on purely psychological grounds, never show the=20
masses two or more opponents, since this leads to a total disin=C2=AC=20
tegration of their fighting power, for this reason alone the thrust=20

1 The struggle carried on by Bismarck against the Catholic Church be=C2=AC=
=20
came known as the Kulturkampf from the words of Rudolf Virchow in the=20
Prussian Diet (January 17, 1873): =E2=80=98The contest has taken on the cha=
racter=20
of a great cultural struggle.=E2=80=99 The struggle was largely released by=
 the=20
proclamation of papal infallibility by the Vatican Council in July, 1870.=
=20
The Jesuits were expelled from Germany, Church schools were subjected to=20
state control, civil marriage was made obligatory, religious orders were di=
s=C2=AC=20
solved, etc.=20


118=20


Mein Kampf=20


of the Pan-German movement would have been directed at a=20
single adversary. Nothing is more dangerous for a political party=20
than to be led by those jacks-of-all-trades who want everything=20
but can never really achieve anything.=20

Regardless how much room for criticism there was in any re=C2=AC=20
ligious denomination a political party must never for a moment=20
lose sight of the fact that in all previous historical experience a=20
purely political party in such situations had never succeeded in=20
producing a religious reformation. And the aim of studying his=C2=AC=20
tory is not to forget its lessons when occasion arises for its practi=C2=AC=
=20
cal application, or to decide that the present situation is different=20
after all, and that therefore its old eternal truths are no longer=20
applicable; no, the purpose of studying history is precisely its=20
lesson for the present. The man who cannot do this must not=20
conceive of himself as a political leader; in reality he is a shallow,=20
though usually very conceited, fool, and no amount of good will=20
can excuse his practical incapacity.=20

In general the art of all truly great national leaders at all times=20
consists among other things primarily in not dividing the atten=C2=AC=20
tion of a people, but in concentrating it upon a single foe. The=20
more unified the application of a people=E2=80=99s will to fight, the great=
er=20
will be the magnetic attraction of a movement and the mightier=20
will be the impetus of the thrust. It belongs to the genius of a=20
great leader to make even adversaries far removed from one an=C2=AC=20
other seem to belong to a single category, because in weak and=20
uncertain characters the knowledge of having different enemies=20
can only too readily lead to the beginning of doubt in their own=20
right.=20

Once the wavering mass sees itself in a struggle against too=20
many enemies, objectivity will put in an appearance, throwing=20
open the question whether all others are really wrong and only=20
their own people or their own movement are in the right.=20

And this brings about the first paralysis of their own power.=20
Hence a multiplicity of different adversaries must always be=20
combined so that in the eyes of the masses of one=E2=80=99s own supporters=
=20
the struggle is directed against only one enemy. This strengthens=20


Anti-Semitism on a Religious Basis=20


119=20


their faith in their own right and enhances their bitterness against=20
those who attack it.=20

That the old Pan-German movement failed to understand this=20
deprived it of success.=20

Its goal had been correct, its will pure, but the road it chose=20
was wrong. It was like a mountain climber who keeps the peak=20
to be climbed in view and who sets out with the greatest deter=C2=AC=20
mination and energy, but pays no attention to the trail, for his=20
eyes are always on his goal, so that he neither sees nor feels out=20
the character of the ascent and thus comes to grief in the end.=20

The opposite state of affairs seemed to prevail with its great=20
competitor, the Christian Social Party.=20

The road it chose was correct and well-chosen, but it lacked=20
clear knowledge of its goal.=20

In nearly all the matters in which the Pan-German movement=20
was wanting, the attitude of the Christian Social Party was cor=C2=AC=20
rect and well-planned.=20

It possessed the necessary understanding for the importance of=20
the masses and from the very first day assured itself of at least a=20
part of them by open emphasis on its social character. By aiming=20
essentially at winning the small and lower middle classes and=20
artisans, it obtained a following as enduring as it was self-sacrific=C2=AC=
=20
ing. It avoided any struggle against a religious institution and=20
thus secured the support of that mighty organization which the=20
Church represents. Consequently, it possessed only a single truly=20
great central opponent. It recognized the value of large-scale=20
propaganda and was a virtuoso in influencing the psychological=20
instincts of the broad masses of its adherents.=20

If nevertheless it was unable to achieve its goal and dream of=20
saving Austria, this was due to two deficiencies in its method and=20
to its lack of clarity concerning the aim itself.=20

The anti-Semitism of the new movement was based on religious=20
ideas instead of racial knowledge. The reason for the intrusion of=20
this mistake was the same which brought about the second fallacy.=20

If the Christian Social Party wanted to save Austria, then in=20
the opinion of its founders it must not operate from the stand-=20


120=20


Mein Kampf=20


point of the racial principle, for if it did a dissolution of the state=20
would, in a short time, inevitably occur. Particularly the situa=C2=AC=20
tion in Vienna itself, in the opinion of the party leaders, de=C2=AC=20
manded that all points which would divide their following should=20
be set aside as much as possible, and that all unifying conceptions=20
be emphasized in their stead.=20

At that time Vienna was so strongly permeated especially with=20
Czech elements that only the greatest tolerance with regard to=20
all racial questions could keep them in a party which was not anti-=20
German to begin with. If Austria were to be saved, this was in=C2=AC=20
dispensable. And so they attempted to win over small Czech=20
artisans who were especially numerous in Vienna, by a struggle=20
against liberal Manchesterism, and in the struggle against the=20
Jews on a religious basis they thought they had discovered-a=20
slogan transcending all of old Austria=E2=80=99s national differences.=20

It is obvious that combating Jewry on such a basis could pro=C2=AC=20
vide the Jews with small cause for concern. If the worst came to=20
the worst, a splash of baptismal water could always save the busi=C2=AC=20
ness and the Jew at the same time. With such a superficial moti=C2=AC=20
vation, a serious scientific treatment of the whole problem was=20
never achieved, and as a result far too many people, to whom this=20
type of anti-Semitism was bound to be incomprehensible, were=20
repelled. The recruiting power of the idea was limited almost=20
exclusively to intellectually limited circles, unless true knowledge=20
were substituted for purely emotional feeling. The intelligentsia=20
remained aloof as a matter of principle. Thus the whole move=C2=AC=20
ment came to look more and more like an attempt at a new con=C2=AC=20
version of the Jews, or perhaps even an expression of a certain=20
competitive envy. And hence the struggle lost the character of=20
an inner and higher consecration; to many, and not necessarily=20
the worst people, it came to seem immoral and reprehensible.=20
Lacking was the conviction that this was a vital question for all=20
humanity, with the fate of ail non-Jewish peoples depending on=20
its solution.=20

Through this half-heartedness the' anti-Semitic line of the=20
Christian Social Party lost its value.=20


Sham Anti-Semitism=20


121=20


It was a sham anti-Semitism which was almost worse than none=20
at all; for it lulled people into security; they thought they had the=20
foe by the ears, while in reality they themselves were being led=20
by the nose.=20

In a short time the Jew had become so accustomed to this=20
type of anti-Semitism that he would have missed its disappear=C2=AC=20
ance more than its presence inconvenienced him.=20

If in this the Christian Social Party had to make a heavy sacri=C2=AC=20
fice to the state of nationalities, they had to make an even greater=20
one when it came to championing Germanism as such.=20

They could not be =E2=80=98 nationalistic 1 unless they wanted to lose=20
the ground from beneath their feet in Vienna. They hoped that=20
by a pussy-footing evasion of this question they could still save=20
the Habsburg state, and by that very thing they encompassed=20
its ruin. And the movement lost the mighty source of power=20
which alone can fill a political party with inner strength for any=20
length of time.=20

Through this alone the Christian Social Party became a party=20
like any other.=20

In those days I followed both movements most attentively.=20
One, by feeling the beat of its innermost heart, the other, carried=20
away by admiration for the unusual man who even then seemed=20
to me a bitter symbol of all Austrian Germanism.=20

When the mighty funeral procession bore the dead mayor from=20
the City Hall toward the Ring, I was among the many hundred=20
thousands looking on at the tragic spectacle. I was profoundly=20
moved and my feelings told me that the work, even of this man,=20
was bound to be in vain, owing to the fatal destiny which would=20
inevitably lead this state to destruction. If Dr. Karl Lueger had=20
lived in Germany, he would have been ranked among the great=20
minds of our people; that he lived and worked in this impossible=20
state was the misfortune of his work and of himself.=20

When he died, the little flames in the Balkans were beginning=20
to leap up more greedily from month to month, and it was a=20
gracious fate which spared him from witnessing what he still=20
thought he could prevent.=20


122=20


Mein Kampe=20


Out of the failure of the one movement and the miscarriage of=20
the other, I for my part sought to find the causes, and came to the=20
certain conviction that, quite aside from the impossibility of=20
bolstering up the state in old Austria, the errors of the two parties=20
were as follows:=20

The Pan-German movement was right in its theoretical view=20
about the aim of a German renascence, but unfortunate in its=20
choice of methods. It was nationalistic, but unhappily not social=C2=AC=20
istic enough to win the masses. But its anti-Semitism was based=20
on a correct understanding of the importance of the racial pro=C2=AC=20
blem, and not on religious ideas. Its struggle against a definite=20
denomination, however, was actually and tactically false.=20

The Christian Social movement had an unclear conception of=20
the aim of a German reawakening, but had intelligence and luck=20
in seeking its methods as a party. It understood the importance=20
of the social question, erred in its struggle against the Jews, and=20
had no notion of the power of the national idea.=20

If, in addition to its enlightened knowledge of the broad masses,=20
the Christian Social Party had had a correct idea of the impor=C2=AC=20
tance of the racial question, such as the Pan-German movement=20
had achieved; and if, finally, it had itself been nationalistic, or if=20
the Pan-German movement, in addition to its correct knowledge=20
of the aim of the Jewish question, had adopted the practical=20
shrewdness of the Christian Social Party, especially in its attitude=20
toward socialism, there would have resulted a movement which=20
even then in my opinion might have successfully intervened in=20
German destiny.=20

If this did not come about, it was overwhelmingly due to the=20
nature of the Austrian state.=20

Since I saw my conviction realized in no other party, I could in=20
the period that followed not make up my mind to enter, let alone=20
fight with, any of the existing organizations. Even then I re=C2=AC=20
garded all political movements as unsuccessful and unable to=20
carry out a national reawakening of the German people on a=20
larger and not purely external scale.=20

But in this period my inner revulsion toward the Habsburg=20
state steadily grew.=20


Growing Aversion to the Habsburg State 123=20

The more particularly I concerned myself with questions of=20
foreign policy, the more my conviction rose and took root that=20
this political formation could result in nothing but the misfortune=20
of Germanism. More and more clearly I saw at last that the fate=20
of the German nation would no longer be decided here, but in the=20
Reich itself. This was true, not only of political questions, but no=20
less for all manifestations of cultural life in general.=20

Also in the field of cultural or artistic affairs, the Austrian state=20
showed all symptoms of degeneration, or at least of unimportance=20
for the German nation. This was most true in the field of archi=C2=AC=20
tecture. The new architecture could achieve no special successes=20
in Austria, if for no other reason because since the completion of=20
the Ring its tasks, in Vienna at least, had become insignificant in=20
comparison with the plans arising in Germany.=20

Thus more and more I began to lead a double life; reason and=20
reality told me to complete a school as bitter as it was beneficial=20
in Austria, but my heart dwelt elsewhere.=20

An oppressive discontent had seized possession of me, the more=20
I recognized the inner hollowness of this state and the impossibil=C2=AC=20
ity of saving it, and felt that in all things it could be nothing but=20
the misfortune of the German people.=20

I was convinced that this state inevitably oppressed and handi=C2=AC=20
capped any really great German as, conversely, it would help=20
every un-German figure.=20

I was repelled by the conglomeration of races which the capital=20
showed me, repelled by this whole mixture of Czechs, Poles,=20
Hungarians, Ruthenians, Serbs, and Croats, and everywhere, the=20
eternal mushroom of humanity =E2=80=94 Jews and more Jews.=20

To me the giant city seemed the embodiment of racial desecra=C2=AC=20
tion.=20

The German of my youth was the dialect of Lower Bavaria; I=20
could neither forget it nor learn the Viennese jargon. The longer=20
I lived in this city, the more my hatred grew for the foreign mix=C2=AC=20
ture of peoples which had begun to corrode this old site of German=20
culture.=20

The idea that this state could be maintained much longer=20
seemed to me positively ridiculous.=20


124=20


Mein Kampf=20


Austria was then like an old mosaic; the cement, binding the=20
various little stones together, had grown old and begun to=20
crumble; as long as the work of art is not touched, it can continue=20
to give a show of existence, but as soon as it receives a blow, it=20
breaks into a thousand fragments. The question was only when=20
the blow would come.=20

Since my heart had never beaten for an Austrian monarchy,=20
but only for a German Reich, the hour of this state=E2=80=99s downfall=20
could only seem to me the beginning of the redemption of the=20
German nation.=20

For all these reasons a longing rose stronger and stronger in me,=20
to go at last whither since my childhood secret desires and secret=20
love had drawn me.=20

I hoped some day to make a name for myself as an architect and=20
thus, on the large or small scale which Fate would allot me, to=20
dedicate my sincere services to the nation.=20

But finally I wanted to enjoy the happiness of living and work=C2=AC=20
ing in the place which some day would inevitably bring about the=20
fulfillment of my most ardent and heartfelt wish: the union of my=20
beloved homeland with the common fatherland, the German=20
Reich.=20

Even today many would be unable to comprehend the great=C2=AC=20
ness of such a longing, but I address myself to those to whom=20
Fate has either hitherto denied this, or from whom in harsh=20
cruelty it has taken it away; I address myself to all those who,=20
detached from their mother country, have to fight even for the=20
holy treasure of their language, who are persecuted and tortured=20
for their loyalty to the fatherland, and who now, with poignant=20
emotion, long for the hour which will permit them to return to=20
the heart of their faithful mother; I address myself to all these,=20
and I know that they will understand me!=20

Only he who has felt in his own skin what it means to be a=20
German, deprived of the right to belong to his cherished father-=20
land, can measure the deep longing which burns at all times in the=20
hearts of children separated from their mother country. It tor=C2=AC=20

piness until the gates of their father=E2=80=99s house open, and in the=20

Yet Vienna was and remained for me the hardest, though most=20
thorough, school of my life. I had set foot in this town while still=20
half a boy and I left it a man, grown quiet and grave. In it I ob=C2=AC=20
tained the foundations for a philosophy in general and a political=20
view in particular which later I only needed to supplement in de=C2=AC=20
tail, but which never left me. But not until today have I been=20
able to estimate at their full value those years of study.=20

That is why I have dealt with this period at some length, be=C2=AC=20
cause it gave me my first visual instruction in precisely those=20
questions which belonged to the foundations of a party which,=20
arising from smallest beginnings, after scarcely five years is be=C2=AC=20
ginning to develop into a great mass movement. I do not know=20
what my attitude toward the Jews, Social Democracy, or rather=20
Marxism as a whole, the social question, etc., would be today if at=20
such an early time the pressure of destiny =E2=80=94 and my own study=20
=E2=80=94 had not built up a basic stock of personal opinions within me.=20

For if the misery of the fatherland can stimulate thousands=20
and thousands of men to thought on the inner reasons for this=20
collapse, this can never lead to that thoroughness and deep in=C2=AC=20
sight which are disclosed to the man who has himself mastered=20
Fate only after years of struggle.=20


CHAPTER=20

IV=20


Munich=20


In the spring of 1912 I came at last to=20


Munich.=20

The city itself was as familiar to me as if I had lived for years=20
within its walls. This is accounted for by my study which at=20
every step had led me to this metropolis of German art. Not only=20
has one not seen Germany if one does not know Munich =E2=80=94 no,=20
above all, one does not know German art if one has not seen=20
Munich.=20

In any case, this period before the War was the happiest and by=20
far the most contented of my life. Even if my earnings were still=20
extremely meager, I did not live to be able to paint, but painted=20
only to be able to secure my livelihood or rather to enable myself=20
to go on studying. I possessed the conviction that I should some=20
day, in spite of all obstacles, achieve the goal I had set myself.=20
And this alone enabled me to bear all other petty cares of daily=20
existence lightly and without anxiety.=20

In addition, to this, there was the heartfelt love which seized=20
me for this city more than for any other place that I knew, almost=20
from the first hour of my sojourn there. A German city! What a=20
difference from Vienna! I grew sick to my stomach when I even=20
thought back on this Babylon of races. In addition, the dialect,=20
much closer to me, which particularly in my contacts with Lower=20
Bavarians, reminded me of my former childhood. There were a=20
thousand and more things which were or became inwardly dear=20


Germany=E2=80=99s Unsound Alliance Policy=20


127=20


and precious to me. But most of all I was attracted by this won=C2=AC=20
derful marriage of primordial power and fine artistic mood, this=20
single line from the Hofbrauhaus to the Odeon, 1 from the October=20
Festival to the Pinakothek, 2 etc. If today I am more attached to=20
this city than to any other spot of earth in this world, it is partly=20
due to the fact that it is and remains inseparably bound up with=20
the development of my own life; if even then I achieved the hap=C2=AC=20
piness of a truly inward contentment, it can be attributed only to=20
the magic which the miraculous residence of the Wittelsbachs=20
exerts on every man who is blessed, not only with a calculating=20
mind but with a feeling soul.=20

What attracted me most aside from my professional work was,=20
here again, the study of the political events of the day, among=20
them particularly the occurrences in the field of foreign affairs. I=20
came to these latter indirectly through the German alliance policy=20
which from my Austrian days I considered absolutely mistaken.=20
However, the full extent of this self-deception on the part of the=20
Reich had not been clear to me in Vienna. In those days I was=20
inclined to assume =E2=80=94 or perhaps I merely talked myself into it as=
=20
an excuse =E2=80=94 that Berlin perhaps knew how weak and unreliable=20
the ally would be in reality, yet, for more or less mysterious rea=C2=AC=20
sons, held back this knowledge in order to bolster up an alliance=20
policy which after all Bismarck himself had founded and the sud=C2=AC=20
den cessation of which could not be desirable, if for no other rea=C2=AC=20
son lest the lurking foreigner be alarmed in any way, or the shop=C2=AC=20
keeper at home be worried.=20

To be sure, my associations, particularly among the people=20
itself, soon made me see to my horror that this belief was false.=20
To my amazement I could not help seeing everywhere that even=20
in otherwise well-informed circles there was not the slightest=20
glimmer of knowledge concerning the nature of the Habsburg=20
monarchy. Particularly the common people were caught in the=20

1 Odeon. Munich=E2=80=99s main concert hall, built by Ludwig I.=20

2 Museum of Art in Munich. The Altere Pinakothek, completed in 1836=20
by Ludwig I of Bavaria, contains many of the finest works of the old master=
s.=20
The Neuere Pinakothek, built in 1846-53, was devoted to contemporary art.=
=20


128=20


Mein Kampe=20


mad idea that the ally could be regarded as a serious power which=20
in the hour of need would surely rise to the situation. Among the=20
masses the monarchy was still regarded as a =E2=80=98German=E2=80=99 state =
on=20
which we could count. They were of the opinion that there, too,=20
the power could be measured by the millions as in Germany itself,=20
and completely forgot that, in the first place: Austria had long=20
ceased to be a German state; and in the second place: the internal=20
conditions of this Empire were from hour to hour moving closer=20
to disintegration.=20

I had come to know this state formation better than the so-=20
called official =E2=80=98 diplomats/ who blindly, as almost always, rushed=
=20
headlong toward catastrophe; for the mood of the people was=20
always a mere discharge of what was funneled into public opinion=20
from above. But the people on top made a cult of the r ally,=E2=80=99 as if=
=20
it were the Golden Calf. They hoped to replace by cordiality=20
what was lacking in honesty. And words were always taken for=20
coin of the realm.=20

Even in Vienna I had been seized with anger when I reflected=20
on the disparity appearing from time to time between the speeches=20
of the official statesmen and the content of the Viennese press.=20
And yet Vienna, in appearance at least, was still a German city.=20
How different it was if you left Vienna, or rather German-Austria,=20
and went to the Slavic provinces of the Empire! You had only to=20
take up the Prague newspapers to find out what they thought of=20
the whole exalted hocus-pocus of the Triple Alliance. There=20
there was nothing but bitter scorn and mockery for this =E2=80=98 master=C2=
=AC=20
piece of statecraft.=E2=80=99 In the midst of peace, with both emperors=20
pressing kisses of friendship on each other=E2=80=99s foreheads, the Czechs=
=20
made no secret of the fact that this alliance would be done for on=20
the day when an attempt should be made to translate it from the=20
moonbeams of the Nibelungen ideal into practical reality.=20

What excitement seized these same people several years later=20
when the time finally came for the alliances to show their worth=20
and Italy leapt out of the triple pact, leaving her two comrades in=20
the lurch, and in the end even becoming their enemy! That any=C2=AC=20
one even for a moment should have dared to believe in the possi-=20


Germany=E2=80=99s Unsound Alliance Policy=20


129=20


bility of such a miracle =E2=80=94 to wit, the miracle that Italy would=20
fight side by side with Austria =E2=80=94 could be nothing but incom=C2=AC=
=20
prehensible to anyone who was not stricken with diplomatic=20
blindness. But in Austria things were not a hair=E2=80=99s-breadth=20
different.=20

In Austria the only exponents of the alliance idea were the=20
Habsburgs and the Germans. The Habsburgs, out of calculation=20
and compulsion; the Germans, from good faith and political =E2=80=94=20
stupidity. From good faith, for they thought that by the Triple=20
Alliance they were performing a great service for the German=20
Reich itself, helping to strengthen and secure it; from political=20
stupidity, because neither did the first-mentioned occur, but on=20
the contrary, they thereby helped to chain the Reich to the corpse=20
of a state which would inevitably drag them both into the abyss,=20
and above all because they themselves, solely by virtue of this=20
alliance, fell more and more a prey to de-Germanization. For by=20
the alliance with the Reich, the Habsburgs thought they could be=20
secure against any interference from this side, which unfortu=C2=AC=20
nately was the case, and thus they were able far more easily and=20
safely to carry through their internal policy of slowly eliminating=20
Germanism. Not only that in view of our well-known * objectiv=C2=AC=20
ity=E2=80=99 they had no need to fear any intervention on the part of the=
=20
Reich government, but, by pointing to the alliance, they could=20
also silence any embarrassing voice among the Austrian-Germans=20
which might rise in German quarters against Slavization of an=20
excessively disgraceful character.=20

For what was the German in Austria to do if the Germans of=20
the Reich recognized and expressed confidence in the Habsburg=20
government? Should he offer resistance and be branded by the=20
entire German public as a traitor to his own nationality? When=20
for decades he had been making the most enormous sacrifices=20
precisely for his nationality!=20

But what value did this alliance have, once Germanism had=20
been exterminated in the Habsburg monarchy? Wasn=E2=80=99t the value=20
of the Triple Alliance for Germany positively dependent on the=20
preservation of German predominance in Austria? Or did they=20


130=20


Mein Kampf=20


really believe that they could live in an alliance with a Slavic-=20
Habsburg Empire?=20

The attitude of official German diplomacy and of all public=20
opinion toward the internal Austrian problem of nationalities=20
was beyond stupidity, it was positively insane! They banked on=20
an alliance, made the future and security of a people of seventy=20
millions dependent on it =E2=80=94 and looked on while the sole basis for=
=20
this alliance was from year to year, inexorably and by plan, being=20
destroyed in the partner-nation. The day was bound to come=20
when a =E2=80=98 treaty=E2=80=99 with Viennese diplomacy would remain, but =
the=20
aid of an allied empire would be lost.=20

With Italy this was the case from the very beginning.=20

If people in Germany had only studied history a little more=20
clearly, and gone into the psychology of nations, they would not=20
have been able to suppose even for an hour that the Quirinal and=20
the Vienna Hofburg would ever stand together in a common=20
fighting front. Sooner would Italy have turned into a volcano=20
than a government have dared to send even a single Italian to the=20
battlefield for the fanatically hated Habsburg state, except as an=20
enemy. More than once in Vienna I saw outbursts of the passion=C2=AC=20
ate contempt and bottomless hatred with which the Italian was=20
=E2=80=98devoted=E2=80=99 to the Austrian state. The sins of the House of H=
abs=C2=AC=20
burg against Italian freedom and independence in the course of=20
the centuries was too great to be forgotten, even if the will to for=C2=AC=
=20
get them had been present. And it was not present; neither in=20
the people nor in the Italian government. For Italy there were=20
therefore two possibilities for relations with Austria: either=20
alliance or war.=20

By choosing the first, the Italians were able to prepare, undis=C2=AC=20
turbed, for the second.=20

Especially since the relation of Austria to Russia had begun to=20
drive closer and closer to a military clash, the German alliance=20
policy was as senseless as it was dangerous.=20

This was a classic case, bearing witness to the absence of any=20
broad and correct line of thinking.=20

Why, then, was an alliance concluded? Only in order better to=20


The Four Roads of German Policy=20


13.1=20


guard the future of the Reich than, reduced to her own resources,=20
she would have been in a position to do. And this future of the=20
Reich was nothing other than the question of preserving the Ger=C2=AC=20
man people=E2=80=99s possibility of existence.=20

Therefore the question could be formulated only as follows:=20

What form must the life of the German nation assume in the=20
tangible future, and how can this development be provided with=20
the necessary foundations and the required security within the=20
framework of general European relation of forces?=20

A clear examination of the premises for foreign activity on the=20
part of German statecraft inevitably led to the following convic=C2=AC=20
tion:=20

Germany has an annual increase in population of nearty nine=20
hundred thousand souls. The difficulty of feeding this army of=20
new citizens must grow greater from year to year and ultimately=20
end in catastrophe, unless ways and means are found to forestall=20
the danger of starvation and misery in time.=20

There were four ways of avoiding so terrible a development for=20
the future:=20

1. Following the French example, the increase of births could be=20
artificially restricted, thus meeting the problem of overpopulation.=20

Nature herself in times of great poverty or bad climatic condi=C2=AC=20
tions, as well as poor harvest, intervenes to restrict the increase=20
of population of certain countries or races; this, to be sure, by a=20
method as wise as it is ruthless. She diminishes, not the power of=20
procreation as such, but the conservation of the procreated, by=20
exposing them to hard trials and deprivations with the result that=20
all those who a,re less strong and less healthy are forced back into=20
the womb of the eternal unknown. Those whom she permits to=20
survive the inclemency of existence are a thousandfold tested,=20
hardened, and well adapted to procreate in turn, in order that the=20
process of thoroughgoing selection may begin again from the be=C2=AC=20
ginning. By thus brutally proceeding against the individual and=20
immediately calling him back to herself as soon as he shows him=C2=AC=20
self unequal to the storm of life, she keeps the race and species=20
strong, in fact, raises them to the highest accomplishments.=20


132=20


Mein Kampf=20


At the same time the diminution of number strengthens the=20
individual and thus in the last analysis fortifies the species.=20

It is different, however, when man undertakes the limitation of=20
his number. He is not carved of the same wood, he is =E2=80=98 humane.=E2=
=80=99=20
He knows better than the cruel queen of wisdom. He limits not=20
the conservation of the individual, but procreation itself. This=20
seems to him, who always sees himself and never the race, more=20
human and more justified than the opposite way. Unfortunately,=20
however, the consequences are the reverse:=20

While Nature, by making procreation free, yet submitting sur=C2=AC=20
vival to a hard trial, chooses from an excess number of individuals=20
the best as worthy of living, thus preserving them alone and in=20
them conserving their species, man limits procreation, but is=20
hysterically concerned that once a being is born it should be pre=C2=AC=20
served at any price. This correction of the divine will seems to=20
him as wise as it is humane, and he takes delight in having once=20
again gotten the best of Nature and even having proved her=20
inadequacy. The number, to be sure, has really been limited, but=20
at the same time the value of the individual has diminished; this,=20
however, is something the dear little ape of the Almighty does not=20
want to see or hear about.=20

For as soon as procreation as such is limited and the number of=20
births diminished, the natural struggle for existence which leaves=20
only the strongest and healthiest alive is obviously replaced by=20
the obvious desire to c save J even the weakest and most sickly at=20
any price, and this plants the seed of a future generation which=20
must inevitably grow more and more deplorable the longer this=20
mockery of Nature and her will continues.=20

And the end will be that such a people will some day be de=C2=AC=20
prived of its existence on this earth; for man can defy the eternal=20
laws of the will to conservation for a certain time, but sooner or=20
later vengeance comes. A stronger race will drive out the weak,=20
for the vital urge in its ultimate form will, time and again, burst=20
all the absurd fetters of the so-called humanity of individuals, in=20
order to replace it by the humanity of Nature which destroys the=20
weak to give his place to the strong.=20


The Four Roads of German Policy=20


133=20


Therefore, anyone who wants to secure the existence of the=20
German people by a self-limitation of its reproduction is robbing=20
it of its future.=20

2. A second way would be one which today we, time and time=20
again, see proposed and recommended: internal colonization.=20
This is a proposal which is well meant by just as many as by most=20
people it is misunderstood, thus doing the greatest conceivable=20
damage that anyone can imagine. 1=20

Without doubt the productivity of the soil can be increased up=20
to a certain limit. But only up to a certain limit, and not continu=C2=AC=
=20
ously without end. For a certain time it will be possible to com=C2=AC=20
pensate for the increase of the German people without having to=20
think of hunger, by increasing the productivity of our soil. But=20
beside this, we must face the fact that our demands on life ordi=C2=AC=20
narily rise even more rapidly than the number of the population.=20
Man=E2=80=99s requirements with regard to food and clothing increase=20
from year to year, and even now, for example, stand in no relation=20
to the requirements of our ancestors, say a hundred years ago.=20
It is, therefore, insane to believe that every rise in production=20
provides the basis for an increase in population: no; this is true=20
only up to a certain degree, since at least a part of the increased=20
production of the soil is spent in satisfying the increased needs of=20
men. But even with the greatest limitation on the one hand and=20
the utmost industry on the other, here again a limit will one day=20
be reached, created by the soil itself. With the utmost toil it will=20
not be possible to obtain any more from it, and then, though post=C2=AC=20
poned for a certain time, catastrophe again manifests itself. First,=20
there will be hunger from time to time, when there is famine, etc.=20
As the population increases, this will happen more and more=20
often, so that finally it will only be absent when rare years of great=20
abundance fill the granaries. But at length the time approaches=20
when even then it will not be possible to satisfy men=E2=80=99s needs, and=
=20
hunger has become the eternal companion of such a people. Then=20
Nature must help again and make a choice among those whom she=20

L =E2=80=98 ... um den denkbar grossten Schaden anzurichten, den man sich n=
ur=20
vorzustellen vermag /=20


134=20


Mein Kampf=20


has chosen for life; but again man helps himself; that is, he turns=20
to artificial restriction of his increase with all the above-indicated=20
dire consequences for race and species.=20

The objection may still be raised that this future will face the=20
whole of humanity in any case and that consequently the individ=C2=AC=20
ual nation can naturally not avoid this fate.=20

At first glance this seems perfectly correct. Yet here the follow=C2=AC=20
ing must be borne in mind:=20

Assuredly at a certain time the whole of humanity will be com=C2=AC=20
pelled, in consequence of the impossibility of making the fertility=20
of the soil keep pace with the continuous increase in population,=20
to halt the increase of the human race and either let Nature again=20
decide or, by self-help if possible, create the necessary balance,=20
though, to be sure, in a more correct way than is done today. But=20
then this will strike all peoples, while today only those races are=20
stricken with such suffering which no longer possess the force and=20
strength to secure for themselves the necessary territories in this=20
world. For as matters stand there are at the present time on this=20
earth immense areas of unusued soil, only waiting for the men to=20
till them. But it is equally true that Nature a.s such has not re=C2=AC=20
served this soil for the future possession of any particular nation=20
or race; on the contrary, this soil exists for the people which=20
possesses the force to take it and the industry to cultivate it.=20

Nature knows no political boundaries. First, she puts living=20
creatures on this globe and watches the free play of forces. She=20
then confers the master=E2=80=99s right on her favorite child, the stronges=
t=20
in courage and industry.=20

When a people limits itself to internal colonization because=20
other races are clinging fast to greater and greater surfaces of this=20
earth, it will be forced to have recourse to self-limitation at a time=20
when the other peoples are still continuing to increase. Some day=20
this situation will arise, and the smaller the living space at the=20
disposal of the people, the sooner it will happen. Since in general,=20
unfortunately, the best nations, or, even more correctly, the only=20
truly cultured races, the standard-bearers of all human progress,=20
all too frequently resolve in their pacifistic blindness to renounce=20


The Four Roads of German Policy=20


135=20


new acquisitions of soil and content themselves with =E2=80=98internal=E2=
=80=99=20
colonization, while the inferior races know how to secure immense=20
living areas in this world for themselves =E2=80=94 this would lead to the=
=20
following final result:=20

The culturally superior, but less ruthless races, would in conse=C2=AC=20
quence of their limited soil, have to limit their increase at a time=20
when the culturally inferior but more brutal and more natural 1=20
peoples, in consequence of their greater living areas, would still=20
be in a position to increase without limit. In other words: some=20
day the world will thus come into possession of the culturally=20
inferior but more active men.=20

Then, though in a perhaps very distant future, there will be but=20
two possibilities either the world will be governed according to=20
the ideas of our modern democracy, and then the weight of any=20
decision will result in favor of the numerically stronger races, or=20
the world will be dominated in accordance with the laws of the=20
natural order of force, and then it is the peoples of brutal will who=20
will conquer, and consequently once again not the nation of self=C2=AC=20
restriction.=20

No one can doubt that this world will some day be exposed to=20
the severest struggles for the existence of mankind. In the end,=20
only the urge for self-preservation can conquer. Beneath it so-=20
called humanity, the expression of a mixture of stupidity, cow=C2=AC=20
ardice, and know-it-all conceit, will melt like snow in the March=20
sun. Mankind has grown great in eternal struggle, and only in=20
eternal peace does it perish.=20

For us Germans the slogan of =E2=80=98inner colonization=E2=80=99 is cata=
=C2=AC=20
strophic, if for no other reason because it automatically reinforces=20
us in the opinion that we have found a means which, in accord=C2=AC=20

to failure. In the face of such an attitude on the part of the na=C2=AC=20
tion any really beneficial foreign policy could be regarded as=20
buried, and with it the future of the German people as a whole.=20

Taking these consequences into account, it is no accident that=20
it is always primarily the Jew who tries and succeeds in planting=20
such mortally dangerous modes of thought in our people. He=20
knows his customers too well not to realize that they gratefully=20
let themselves be swindled by any gold-brick salesman who can=20
make them think he has found a way to play a little trick on Na=C2=AC=20
ture, to make the hard, inexorable struggle for existence superflu=C2=AC=20
ous, and instead, sometimes by work, but sometimes by plain=20
doing nothing, depending on how things =E2=80=98come out/ to become=20
the lord of the planet.=20

It cannot be emphasized sharply enough that any German in=C2=AC=20
ternal colonization must serve to eliminate social abuses particularly=20
to withdraw the soil from widespread speculation , but can never=20
suffice to secure the future of the nation without the acquisition of new=
=20
soil .=20

If we do not do this, we shall in a short time have arrived, not=20
only at the end of our soil, but also at the end of our strength.=20

Finally, the following must be stated:=20

The limitation to a definite small area of soil, inherent in in=C2=AC=20
ternal colonization, like the same final effect obtained by restric=C2=AC=
=20
tion of procreation, leads to an exceedingly unfavorable politico-=20
military situation in the nation in question.=20

The size of the area inhabited by a people constitutes in itself=20
an essential factor for determining its outward security. The=20
greater the quantity of space at the disposal of a people, the=20
greater its natural protection; for military decisions against peo=C2=AC=20
ples living in a small restricted area have always been obtained=20
more quickly and hence more easily, and in particular more effec=C2=AC=20
tively and completely, than can, conversely, be possible against=20


The Four Roads of German Policy=20


137=20


territorially extensive states. In the size of a state=E2=80=99s territory=
=20
there always lies a certain protection against frivolous attacks,=20
since success can be achieved only after hard struggles, and there=C2=AC=20
fore the risk of a rash assault will seem too great unless there are=20
quite exceptional grounds for it. Hence the very size of a state=20
offers in itself a basis for more easily preserving the freedom and=20
independence of a people, while, conversely, the smallness of such=20
a formation is a positive invitation to seizure.=20

Actually the two first possibilities for creating a balance be=C2=AC=20
tween the rising population and the stationary amount of soil=20
were rejected in the so-called national circles of the Reich. The=20
reasons for this position were, to be sure, different from those=20
above mentioned: government circles adopted a negative attitude=20
toward the limitation of births out of a certain moral feeling; they=20
indignantly rejected internal colonization because in it they=20
scented an attack against large landholdings and therein the be=C2=AC=20
ginning of a wider struggle against private property in general.=20
In view of the form in which particularly the latter panacea was=20
put forward, they may very well have been right in this assump=C2=AC=20
tion.=20

On the whole, the defense against the broad masses was not=20
very skillful and by no means struck at the heart of the problem.=20

Thus there remained but two ways of securing work and bread=20
for the rising population.=20

3. Either new soil could be acquired and the superfluous mil=C2=AC=20
lions sent off each year, thus keeping the nation on a self-sustain=C2=AC=
=20
ing basis; or we could=20

4. Produce for foreign needs through industry and commerce,=20
and defray the cost of living from the proceeds.=20

In other words: either a territorial policy, or a colonial and com=C2=AC=20
mercial policy.=20

Both ways were contemplated, examined, recommended, and=20
combated by different political tendencies, and the last was finally=20
taken.=20

The healthier way of the two would, to be sure, have been the=20
first.=20


138=20


Mein Kampp=20


The acquisition of new soil for the settlement of the excess=20
population possesses an infinite number of advantages, particu=C2=AC=20
larly if we turn from the present to the future.=20

For one thing, the possibility of preserving a healthy peasant=20
class as a foundation for a whole nation can never be valued highly=20
enough. Many of our present-day sufferings are only the conse=C2=AC=20
quence of the unhealthy relationship between rural and city=20
population. A solid stock of small and middle peasants has at all=20
times been the best defense against social ills such as we possess=20
today. And, moreover, this is the only solution which enables a=20
nation to earn its daily bread within the inner circuit of its econ=C2=AC=
=20
omy. Industry and commerce recede from their unhealthy lead=C2=AC=20
ing position and adjust themselves to the general framework of a=20
national economy of balanced supply and demand. Both thus=20
cease to be the basis of the nation=E2=80=99s sustenance and become a=20
mere instrument to that end. Since they now have only a bal=C2=AC=20
ance 1 between domestic production and demand in all fields, they=20
make the subsistence of the people as a whole more or less inde=C2=AC=20
pendent of foreign countries, and thus help to secure the freedom=20
of the state and the independence of the nation, particularly in=20
difficult periods.=20

It must be said that such a territorial policy cannot be fulfilled=20
in the Cameroons, but today almost exclusively in Europe. We=20
must, therefore, coolly and objectively adopt the standpoint that=20
it can certainly not be the intention of Heaven to give one people=20
fifty times as much land and soil in this world as another. In this=20
case we must not let political boundaries obscure for us the bound=C2=AC=20
aries of eternal justice. If this earth really has room for all to live=20
in, let us be given the soil we need for our livelihood.=20

True, they will not willingly do this. But then the law of self-=20
preservation goes into effect; and what is refused to amicable=20

Acquisition of New Land=20

methods, it is up to the fist to take. If our forefathers had let=20
their decisions depend on the same pacifistic nonsense as our=20
contemporaries, we should possess only a third of our present=20
territory; but in that case there would scarcely be any German=20
people for us to worry about in Europe today. No =E2=80=94 it is to our=20
natural determination to fight for our own existence that we owe=20
the two Ostmarks 1 of the Reich and hence that inner strength=20
arising from the greatness of our state and national territory=20
which alone has enabled us to exist up to the present.=20

And for another reason this would have been the correct solution:=20

Today many European states are like pyramids stood on their=20
heads. Their European area is absurdly small in comparison to=20
their weight of colonies, foreign trade, etc. We may say: summit=20
in Europe, base in the whole world; contrasting with the Ameri=C2=AC=20
can Union which possesses its base in its own continent and=20
touches the rest of the earth only with its summit. And from this=20
comes the immense inner strength of this state and the weakness=20
of most European colonial powers.=20

Nor is England any proof to the contrary, since in considera=C2=AC=20
tion of the British Empire we too easily forget the Anglo-Saxon=20
world as such. The position of England, if only because of her=20
linguistic and cultural bond with the American Union, can be=20
compared to no other state in Europe.=20

For Germany, consequently, the only possibility for carrying=20
out a healthy territorial policy lay in the acquisition of new land=20
in Europe itself. Colonies cannot serve this purpose unless they=20
seem in large part suited for settlement by Europeans. But in the=20
nineteenth century such colonial territories were no longer ob=C2=AC=20
tainable by peaceful means. Consequently, such a colonial policy=20
could only have been carried out by means of a hard struggle=20
which, however, would have been carried on to much better pur=C2=AC=20
pose, not for territories outside of Europe, but for land on the=20
home continent itself.=20

1 The two Ostmarks are the Bavarian O., or Austria, and the German 0.,=20
meaning the territories bordering on Poland. The second came into use=20
among nationalist circles in the late nineteenth century.=20


140=20


Mein Kampf=20


Such a decision, it is true, demands undivided devotion. It is=20
not permissible to approach with half measures or even with hesi=C2=AC=20
tation a task whose execution seems possible only by the harness=C2=AC=20
ing of the very last possible ounce of energy. This means that the=20
entire political leadership of the Reich should have devoted itself=20
to this exclusive aim; never should any step have been taken,=20
guided by other considerations than the recognition of this task=20
and its requirements. It was indispensable to see clearly that this=20
aim could be achieved only by struggle, and consequently to face=20
the contest of arms with calm and composure.=20

All alliances, therefore, should have been viewed exclusively=20
from this standpoint and judged according to their possible utili=C2=AC=20
zation. If land was desired in Europe, it could be obtained by=20
and large only at the expense of Russia, and this meant that the=20
new Reich must again set itself on the march along the road of the=20
Teutonic Knights of old, to obtain by the German sword sod for=20
the German plow and daily bread for the nation.=20

For such a policy there was but one ally in Europe: England.=20

With England alone was it possible, our rear protected, to be=C2=AC=20
gin the new Germanic march. Our right to do this would have=20
been no less than the right of our forefathers. None of our paci=C2=AC=20
fists refuses to eat the bread of the East, although the first plow=C2=AC=
=20
share in its day bore the name of =E2=80=98sword=E2=80=99!=20

Consequently, no sacrifice should have been too great for win=C2=AC=20
ning England=E2=80=99s willingness. We should have renounced colonies=20
and sea power, and spared English industry our competition.=20

Only an absolutely clear orientation could lead to such a goal:=20
renunciation of world trade and colonies; renunciation of a Ger=C2=AC=20
man war fleet; concentration of all the state=E2=80=99s instruments of=20
power on the land army.=20

The result, to be sure, would have been a momentary limita=C2=AC=20
tion, but a great and mighty future.=20

There was a time when England would have listened to reason=20
on this point, since she was well aware that Germany as a result=20
of her increased population had to seek some way out and either=20
find it with England in Europe or without England in the world.=20


The Austrian Alliance=20


141=20


And it can primarily be attributed to this realization if at the=20
turn of the century London itself attempted to approach Ger=C2=AC=20
many. For the first time a thing became evident which in the last=20
years we have had occasion to observe in a truly terrifying fash=C2=AC=20
ion. People were unpleasantly affected by the thought of having=20
to pull England=E2=80=99s chestnuts out of the fire; as though there ever=
=20
could be an alliance on any other basis than a mutual business=20
deal. And with England such a deal could very well have been=20
made. British diplomacy was still clever enough to realize that=20
no service can be expected without a return.=20

Just suppose that an astute German foreign policy had taken=20
over the role of Japan in 1904, and we can scarcely measure the=20
consequences this would have had for Germany.=20

There would never have been any =E2=80=98World War.=E2=80=99=20

The bloodshed in the year 1904 would have saved ten times=20
as much in the years 1914 to 1918.=20

And what a position Germany would occupy in the world=20
today!=20

In that light, to be sure, the alliance with Austria was an=20
absurdity.=20

For this mummy of a state allied itself with Germany, not in=20
order to fight a war to its end, but for the preservation of an=20
eternal peace which could astutely be used for the slow but=20
certain extermination of Germanism in the monarchy.=20

This alliance was an impossibility for another reason: because=20
we could not expect a state to take the offensive in championing=20
national German interests as long as this state did not possess=20
the power and determination to put an end to the process of=20
de-Germanization on its own immediate borders. If Germany=20
did not possess enough national awareness and ruthless deter=C2=AC=20
mination to snatch power over the destinies of ten million na=C2=AC=20
tional comrades from the hands of the impossible Habsburg=20
state, then truly we had no right to expect that she would ever=20
lend her hand to such farseeing and bold plans. The attitude of=20
the old Reich on the Austrian question was the touchstone of its=20
conduct in the struggle for the destiny of the whole nation.=20


142=20


Mein Kampf=20


In any case we were not justified in looking on/ as year after=20
year Germanism was increasingly repressed, since the value of=20
Austria=E2=80=99s fitness for alliance was determined exclusively by the=20
preservation of the German element.=20

This road, however, was not taken at all.=20

These people feared nothing so much as struggle, yet they were=20
finally forced into it at the most unfavorable hour.=20

They wanted to run away from destiny, and it caught up with=20
them. They dreamed of preserving world peace, and landed in=20
the World War.=20

And this was the most significant reason why this third way=20
of molding the German future was not even considered. They=20
knew that the acquisition of new soil was possible only in the=20
East, they saw the struggle that would be necessary and yet=20
wanted peace at any price; for the w r atchword of German foreign=20
policy had long ceased to be: preservation of the German nation=20
by all methods; but rather: preservation of world peace by all=20
means. With what success, everyone knows.=20

I shall return to this point in particular.=20

Thus there remained the fourth possibility:=20

Industry and world trade, sea power and colonies.=20

Such a development, to be sure, was at first easier and also=20
more quickly attainable. The settlement of land is a slow process,=20
often lasting centuries; in fact, its inner strength is to be sought=20
precisely in the fact that it is not a sudden blaze, but a gradual=20
yet solid and continuous growth, contrasting with an industrial=20
development which can be blown up in the course of a few years,=20
but in that case is more like a soapbubble than solid strength.=20
A fleet, to be sure, can be built more quickly than farms can be=20
established in stubborn struggle and settled with peasants, but=20
it is also more rapidly destroyed than the latter.=20

If, nevertheless, Germany took this road, she should at least=20
have clearly recognized that this development would some day=20
likewise end in struggle. Only children could have thought that=20
they could get their bananas in the =E2=80=98peaceful contest of nations,=
=E2=80=99=20
by friendly and moral conduct and constant emphasis on their=20


With Russia Against England=20


143=20


peaceful intentions, as they so high-soundingly and unctuously=20
babbled; in other words, without ever having to take up arms.=20
No: if we chose this road, England would some day inevitably=20
become our enemy. It was more than senseless =E2=80=94 but quite in=20
keeping with our own innocence =E2=80=94 to wax indignant over the=20
fact that England should one day take the liberty to oppose our=20
peaceful activity with the brutality of a violent egoist.=20

It is true that we, I am sorry to say, would never have done=20
such a thing.=20

If a European territorial policy was only possible against=20
Russia in alliance with England, conversely, a policy of colonies=20
and world trade was conceivable only against England and with=20
Russia. But then we had dauntlessly to draw the consequences =E2=80=94=20
and, above all, abandon Austria in all haste.=20

Viewed from all angles, this alliance with Austria was real=20
madness by the turn of the century.=20

But we did not think of concluding an alliance with Russia=20
against England, any more than with England against Russia,=20
for in both cases the end would have been war, and to prevent=20
this we decided in favor of a policy of commerce and industry.=20
In the peaceful economic=E2=80=99 conquest of the world we possessed a=20
recipe which was expected to break the neck of the former policy=20
of violence once and for all. 1 Occasionally, perhaps, we were not=20
quite sure of ourselves, particularly when from time to time in=C2=AC=20
comprehensible threats came over from England; therefore, we=20
decided to build a fleet, though not to attack and destroy Eng=C2=AC=20
land, but for the =E2=80=98defense=E2=80=99 of our old friend =E2=80=98worl=
d peace=E2=80=99 and=20
=E2=80=98peaceful=E2=80=99 conquest of the world. Consequently, it was kept=
 on a=20
somewhat more modest scale in all respects, not only in number=20
but also in the tonnage of the individual ships as well as in arma=C2=AC=20
ment, so as in the final analysis to let our =E2=80=98peaceful=E2=80=99 int=
entions=20
shine through after all.=20

The talk about the =E2=80=98peaceful economic=E2=80=99 conquest of the worl=
d=20
was possibly the greatest nonsense which has ever been exalted=20
to be a guiding principle of state policy. What made this non-=20

11 die der bisherigen Gewaltpolitik ein fur allemal das Genick brechen soll=
ted=20


144=20


Mein Kampe=20


sense even worse was that its proponents did not hesitate to call=20
upon England as a crown witness for the possibility of such an=20
achievement. The crimes of our academic doctrine and concep=C2=AC=20
tion of history in this connection can scarcely be made good and=20
are only a striking proof of how many people there are who=20
=E2=80=98learn =E2=80=99 history without understanding or even comprehendin=
g it.=20
England, in particular, should have been recognized as the strik=C2=AC=20
ing refutation of this theory; for no people has ever with greater=20
brutality better prepared its economic conquests with the sword,=20
and later ruthlessly defended them, 1 than the English nation.=20
Is it not positively the distinguishing feature of British states=C2=AC=20
manship to draw economic acquisitions from political strength,=20
and at once to recast every gain in economic strength into po=C2=AC=20
litical power? And what an error to believe that England is=20
personally too much of a coward to stake her own blood for her=20
economic policy! The fact that the English people possessed no=20
=E2=80=98people=E2=80=99s army=E2=80=99 in no way proved the contrary; for =
what matters=20
is not the momentary military form of the fighting forces, but=20
rather the will and determination to risk those which do exist.=20
England has always possessed whatever armament she happened=20
to need. She always fought with the weapons which success=20
demanded. She fought with mercenaries as long as mercenaries=20
sufficed; but she reached down into the precious blood of the=20
whole nation when only such a sacrifice could bring victory;=20
but the determination for victory, the tenacity and ruthless=20
pursuit of this struggle, remained unchanged.=20

In Germany, however, the school, the press, and comic maga=C2=AC=20
zines cultivated a conception of the Englishman=E2=80=99s character, and=20
almost more so of his empire, which inevitably led to one of the=20
most insidious delusions; for gradually everyone was infected=20
by this nonsense, and the consequence was an underestimation=20
for which we would have to pay most bitterly. This falsification=20
went so deep that people became convinced that in the English=C2=AC=20
man they faced a business man as shrewd as personally he was=20

=20


Inner Weakness of the Triple Alliance=20


145=20


unbelievably cowardly. The fact that a world empire the size=20
of the British could not be put together by mere subterfuge and=20
swindling was unfortunately something that never even occurred=20
to our exalted professors of academic science. The few who=20
raised a voice of warning were ignored or killed by silence. I=20
remember well my comrades=E2=80=99 looks of astonishment when we=20
faced the Tommies in person in Flanders. After the very first=20
days of battle the conviction dawned on each and every one of=20
them that these Scotsmen did not exactly jibe with the pictures=20
they had seen fit to give us in the comic magazines and press=20
dispatches.=20

It was then that I began my first reflections about the import=C2=AC=20
ance of the form of propaganda.=20

This falsification, however, did have one good side for those who=20
spread it: by this example, even though it was incorrect, they=20
were able to demonstrate the correctness of the economic con=C2=AC=20
quest of the world. If the Englishman had succeeded, we too=20
were bound to succeed, and our definitely greater honesty, the=20
absence in us of that specifically English =E2=80=98perfidy,=E2=80=99 was r=
egarded=20
as a very special plus. For it was hoped that this would enable=20
us to win the affection, particularly of the smaller nations, and=20
the confidence of the large ones the more easily.=20

It did not occur to us that our honesty was a profound horror=20
to the others, if for no other reason because we ourselves be=C2=AC=20
lieved all these things seriously while the rest of the world re=C2=AC=20
garded such behavior as the expression of a special slyness and=20
disingenuousness, until, to their great, infinite amazement, the=20
revolution gave them a deeper insight into the boundless stu=C2=AC=20
pidity of our honest convictions.=20

However, the absurdity of this =E2=80=98economic conquest=E2=80=99 at once=
=20
made the absurdity of the Triple Alliance clear and comprehensi=C2=AC=20
ble. For with what other state could we ally ourselves? In=20
alliance with Austria, to be sure, we could not undertake any=20
military conquest, even in Europe alone. Precisely therein con=C2=AC=20
sisted the inner weakness of the alliance from the very first day.=20
A Bismarck could permit himself this makeshift, but not by a=20


146=20


Mein Kampf=20


long shot every bungling successor, least of all at a time when=20
certain essential premises of Bismarck=E2=80=99s alliance had long ceased=
=20
to exist; for Bismarck still believed that in Austria he had to do=20
with a German state. But with the gradual introduction of uni=C2=AC=20
versal suffrage, this country had sunk to the status of an un-=20
German hodgepodge with a parliamentary government.=20

Also from the standpoint of racial policy, the alliance with=20
Austria was simply ruinous. It meant tolerating the growth of a=20
new Slavic power on the borders of the Reich, a power which=20
sooner or later would have to take an entirely different attitude=20
toward Germany than, for example, Russia. And from year to=20
year the alliance itself was bound to grow inwardly hollower and=20
weaker in proportion as the sole supporters of this idea in the=20
monarchy lost influence and were shoved out of the most decisive=20
positions.=20

By the turn of the century the alliance with Austria had entered=20
the very same stage as Austria=E2=80=99s pact with Italy.=20

Here again there were only two possibilities: either we were in=20
a pact with the Habsburg monarchy or we had to lodge protest=20
against the repression of Germanism. But once a power embarks=20
on this kind of undertaking, it usually ends in open struggle.=20

Even psychologically the value of the Triple Alliance was small,=20
since the stability of an alliance increases in proportion as the=20
individual contracting parties can hope to achieve definite and=20
tangible expansive aims. And, conversely, it will be the weaker=20
the more it limits itself to the preservation of an existing condi=C2=AC=20
tion. Here,- as everywhere else, strength lies not in defense but=20
in attack.=20

Even then this was recognized in various quarters, unfortu=C2=AC=20
nately not by the so-called =E2=80=98 authorities.=E2=80=99 Particularly Lu=
den-=20
dorff, then a colonel and officer in the great general staff, pointed=20
to these weaknesses in a memorial written in 1912. Of course,=20

147=20


For Germany it was sheer good fortune that in 1914 the war=20
broke out indirectly through Austria, so that the Habsburgs=20
were forced to take part; for if it had happened the other way=20
around Germany would have been alone. Never would the=20
Habsburg state have been able, let alone willing, to take part=20
in a conflict which would have arisen through Germany. What=20
we later so condemned in Italy would then have happened=20
even earlier with Austria: they would have remained 1 neutral=E2=80=99=20
in order at least to save the state from a revolution at the very=20
start. Austrian Slavdom would rather have shattered the=20
monarchy even in 1914 than permit aid to Germany.=20

How great were the dangers and difficulties entailed by the=20
alliance with the Danubian monarchy, only very few realized a'=20
that time.=20

In the first place, Austria possessed too many enemies who=20
were planning to grab what they could from the rotten state to=20
prevent a certain hatred from arising in the course of time=20
against Germany, in whom they saw the cause of preventing=20
the generally hoped and longed-for collapse of the monarchy.=20
They came to the conviction that Vienna could finally be reached=20
only by a detour through Berlin.=20

In the second place, Germany thus lost her best and most=20
hopeful possibilities of alliance. They were replaced by an ever-=20
mounting tension with Russia and even Italy. For in Rome the=20
general mood was just as pro-German as it was anti-Austrian,=20
slumbering in the heart of the very last Italian and often brightly=20
flaring up.=20

Now, since we had thrown ourselves into a policy of commerce=20
and industry, there was no longer the slightest ground for war=20
against Russia either. Only the enemies of both nations could=20
still have an active interest in it. And actually these were prima=C2=AC=20
rily the Jews and the Marxists, who, with every means, incited=20
and agitated for war between the two states.=20

Thirdly and lastly, this alliance inevitably involved an infinite=20
peril for Germany, because a great power actually hostile to=20
Bismarck=E2=80=99s Reich could at any time easily succeed in mobilizing=20


148=20


Mein Kampf=20


a whole series of states against Germany, since it was in a posi=C2=AC=20
tion to promise each of them enrichment at the expense of our=20
Austrian ally.=20

The whole East of Europe could be stirred up against the=20
Danubian monarchy =E2=80=94 particularly Russia and Italy. Never=20
would the world coalition which had been forming since the=20
initiating efforts of King Edward have come into existence if=20
Austria as Germany=E2=80=99s ally had not represented too tempting a=20
legacy. This alone made it possible to bring states with other=C2=AC=20
wise so heterogeneous desires and aims into a single offensive=20
front. Each one could hope that in case of a general action=20
against Germany it, too, would achieve enrichment at Austria=E2=80=99s=20
expense. The danger was enormously increased by the fact that=20
Turkey seemed to be a silent partner in this unfortunate alliance.=20

International Jewish world finance needed these lures to enable=20
it to carry out its long-desired plan for destroying the Germany=20
which thus far did not submit to its widespread superstate con=C2=AC=20
trol of finance and economics. Only in this way could they=20
forge a coalition made strong and courageous by the sheer num=C2=AC=20
bers of the gigantic armies now on the march and prepared to=20
attack the horny 1 Siegfried at last.=20

The alliance with the Habsburg monarchy, which even in=20
Austria had filled me with dissatisfaction, now became the source=20
of long inner trials which in the time to come reinforced me even=20
more in the opinion I had already conceived.=20

Even then, among those few people whom I frequented, I=20
made no secret of my conviction that our catastrophic alliance=20
with a state on the brink of ruin would also lead to a fatal col=C2=AC=20
lapse of Germany unless we knew enough to release ourselves=20
from it on time. This conviction of mine was firm as a rock, and=20
I did not falter in it for one moment when at last the storm of=20
the World War seemed to have excluded all reasonable thought=20
and a frenzy of enthusiasm had seized even those quarters for=20

the beast as it passes over him. The dragon=E2=80=99s blood pours over Sieg=

makes his skin =E2=80=98horny,=E2=80=99 invulnerable.=20


State and Economic Life=20


149=20


which there should have been only the coldest consideration of=20
reality. And while I myself was at the front, I put forward, when=C2=AC=20
ever these problems were discussed, my opinion that the alliance=20
had to be broken off, the quicker the better for the German nation,=20
and that the sacrifice of the Habsburg monarchy would be no=20
sacrifice at all to make if Germany thereby could achieve a re=C2=AC=20
striction of her adversaries; for it was not for the preservation=20
of a debauched dynasty that the millions had donned the steel=20
helmet, but for the salvation of the German nation.=20

On a few occasions before the War it seemed as though, in=20
one camp at least, a gentle doubt was arising as to the correct=C2=AC=20
ness of the alliance policy that had been chosen. German con=C2=AC=20
servative circles began from time to time to warn against excessive=20
confidence, but, like everything else that was sensible, this was=20
thrown to the winds. They were convinced that they were on=20
the path to a world =E2=80=98conquest/ whose success would be tremen=C2=AC=
=20
dous and which would entail practically no sacrifices.=20

There was nothing for those not in authority to do but to=20
watch in silence why and how the =E2=80=98 authorities =E2=80=99 marched st=
raight=20
to destruction, drawing the dear people behind them like the=20
Pied Piper of Hamelin.=20

The deeper cause that made it possible to represent the=20
absurdity of an =E2=80=98economic conquest=E2=80=99 as a practical politica=
l=20
method, and the preservation of =E2=80=98world peace=E2=80=99 as a politica=
l=20
goal for a whole people, and even to make these things intelli=C2=AC=20
gible, lay in the general sickening of our whole political thinking.=20

With the victorious march of German technology and industry,=20
the rising successes of German commerce, the realization was=20
increasingly lost that all this was only possible on the basis of a=20
strong state. On the contrary, many circles went so far as to put=20
forward the conviction that the state owed its very existence to=20
these phenomena, that the state itself primarily represented an=20


150=20


Mein Kampf=20


economic institution, that it could be governed according to=20
economic requirements, and that its very existence depended on=20
economics, a state of affairs which was regarded and glorified as=20
by far the healthiest and most natural.=20

But the state has nothing at all to do with any definite eco=C2=AC=20
nomic conception or development.=20

It is not a collection of economic contracting parties in a=20
definite delimited living space for the fulfillment of economic=20
tasks, but the organization of a community of physically and=20
psychologically similar living beings for the better facilitation of=20
the maintenance of their species and the achievement of the aim=20
which has been allotted to this species by Providence. This and=20
nothing else is the aim and meaning of a state. Economics is=20
only one of the many instruments required for the achievement of=20
this aim. It is never the cause or the aim of a state unless this=20
state is based on a false, because unnatural, foundation to begin=20
with. Only in this way can it be explained that the state as such=20
does not necessarily presuppose territorial limitation. This will=20
be necessary only among the peoples who want to secure the=20
maintenance of their national comrades by their own resources;=20
in other words, are prepared to fight the struggle for existence=20
by their own labor. Peoples who can sneak their way into the=20
rest of mankind like drones, to make other men work for them=20
under all sorts of pretexts, can form states even without any=20
definitely delimited living space of their own. This applies first=20
and foremost to a people under whose parasitism the whole of=20
honest humanity is suffering, today more than ever: the Jews.=20

The Jewish state was never spatially limited in itself, but uni=C2=AC=20
versally unlimited as to space, though restricted in the sense of=20
embracing but one race. Consequently, this people has always=20
formed a state within states. It is one of the most ingenious=20
tricks that was ever devised, to make this state sail under the=20
flag of =E2=80=98 religion/ thus assuring it of the tolerance which the=20
Aryan is always ready to accord a religious creed. For actually=20
the Mosaic religion is nothing other than a doctrine for the=20
preservation of the Jewish race. It therefore embraces almost all=20


State and Economic Life=20


151=20


sociological, political, and economic fields of knowledge which=20
can have any bearing on this function.=20

The urge to preserve the species is the first cause for the for=C2=AC=20
mation of human communities; thus the state is a national=20
organism and not an economic organization. A difference which=20
is just as large as it is incomprehensible, particularly to our=20
so-called 4 statesmen =E2=80=99 of today. That is why they think they can=
=20
build up the state through economics while in reality it results=20
and always will result solely from the action of those qualities=20
which lie in line with the will to preserve the species and race.=20
And these are always heroic virtues and never the egoism of=20
shopkeepers, since the preservation of the existence of a species=20
presupposes a spirit of sacrifice in the individual. The sense of=20
the poet=E2=80=99s words, =E2=80=98If you will not stake your life, you wil=
l win no=20
life,=E2=80=99 is that the sacrifice of personal existence is necessary to=
=20
secure the preservation of the species. Thus, the most sensible=20
prerequisite for the formation and preservation of a state is the=20
presence of a certain feeling of cohesion based on similarity of=20
nature and species, and a willingness to stake everything on it=20
with all possible means, something which in peoples with soil=20
of their own will create heroic virtues, but in parasites will create=20
lying hypocrisy and malignant cruelty, or else these qualities=20
must already be present as the necessary and demonstrable=20
basis for their existence as a state so different in form. The=20
formation of a state, originally at least, will occur through the=20
exercise of these qualities, and in the subsequent struggle for=20
self-preservation those nations will be defeated =E2=80=94 that is, will=20
fall a prey to subjugation and thus sooner or later die out =E2=80=94=20
which in the mutual struggle possess the smallest share of heroic=20
virtues, or are not equal to the lies and trickery of the hostile=20
parasite. But in this case, too, this must almost always be=20
attributed less to a lack of astuteness than to a lack of deter=C2=AC=20
mination and courage, which only tries to conceal itself beneath=20
a cloak of humane convictions.=20

How little the state-forming and state-preserving qualities are=20
connected with economics is most clearly shown by the fact that=20


152=20


Mein Kampf=20


the inner strength of a state only in the rarest cases coincides=20
with so-called economic prosperity, but that the latter, in in=C2=AC=20
numerable cases, seems to indicate the state=E2=80=99s approaching=20
decline. If the formation of human societies were primarily=20
attributable to economic forces or even impulses, the highest=20
economic development would have to mean the greatest strength=20
of the state and not the opposite.=20

Belief in the state-forming and state-preserving power of eco=C2=AC=20
nomics seems especially incomprehensible when it obtains in a=20
country which in all things clearly and penetratingly shows the=20
historic reverse. Prussia, in particular, demonstrates with mar=C2=AC=20
velous sharpness that not material qualities but ideal virtues=20
alone make possible the formation of a state. Only under their=20
protection can economic life flourish, until with the collapse of=20
the pure state-forming faculties the economy collapses too; a=20
process which we can observe in so terrible and tragic a form=20
right now. The material interests of man can always thrive=20
best as long as they remain in the shadow of heroic virtues; but=20
as soon as they attempt to enter the primary sphere of existence,=20
they destroy the basis for their own existence.=20

Always when in Germany there was an upsurge of political=20
power, the economic conditions began to improve; but always=20
when economics became the sole content of our people=E2=80=99s life,=20
stifling the ideal virtues, the state collapsed and in a short time=20
drew economic life along with it.=20

If, however, we consider the question, what, in reality, are=20
the state-forming or even state-preserving forces, we can sum=20
them up under one single head: the ability and will of the indi=C2=AC=20
vidual to sacrifice himself for the totality. That these virtues=20
have nothing at all to do with economics can be seen from the=20
simple realization that man never sacrifices himself for the latter,=20
or, in other words: a man does not die for business, but only for=20
ideals. Nothing proved the Englishman=E2=80=99s superior psychological=20
knowledge of the popular soul better than the motivation which=20
he gave to his struggle. While we fought for bread, England=20
fought for =E2=80=98freedom=E2=80=99; and not even for her own, no, for tha=
t of=20


State and Economic Life=20


153=20


the small nations. In our country we laughed at this effrontery,=20
or were enraged at it, and thus only demonstrated how empty-=20
headed and stupid the so-called statesmen of Germany had be=C2=AC=20
come even before the War. We no longer had the slightest idea=20
concerning the essence of the force which can lead men to their=20
death of their own free will and decision.=20

In 1914, as long as the German people thought they were=20
fighting for ideals, they stood firm; but as soon as they were told=20
to fight for their daily bread, they preferred to give up the game.=20

And our brilliant =E2=80=98statesmen=E2=80=99 were astonished at this chang=
e=20
in attitude. It never became clear to them that from the moment=20
when a man begins to fight for an economic interest, he avoids=20
death as much as possible, since death would forever deprive=20
him of his reward for fighting. Anxiety for the rescue of her=20
own child makes a heroine of even the feeblest mother, and only=20
the struggle for the preservation of the species and the hearth,=20
or the state that protects it, has at all times driven men against=20
the spears of their enemies.=20

The following theorem may be established as an eternally=20
valid truth:=20

Never yet has a state been founded by peaceful economic=20
means, but always and exclusively by the instincts of preserva=C2=AC=20
tion of the species regardless whether these are found in the=20
province of heroic virtue or of cunning craftiness; the one results=20
in Aryan states based on work and culture, the other in Jewish=20
colonies of parasites. As soon as economics as such begins to=20
choke out these instincts in a people or in a state, it becomes=20
the seductive cause of subjugation and oppression.=20

The belief of pre-war days that the world could be peacefully=20
opened up to, let alone conquered for, the German people by a=20
commercial and colonial policy was a classic sign of the loss of=20
real state-forming and state-preserving virtues and of all the=20
insight, will power, and active determination which follow from=20
them; the penalty for this, inevitable as the law of nature, was=20
the World War with its consequences.=20

For those who do not look more deeply into the matter, this=20


154=20


Mein Kampe=20


attitude of the German nation =E2=80=94 for it was really as good as=20
general =E2=80=94 could only represent an insoluble riddle: for was not=20
Germany above all other countries a marvelous example of an=20
empire which had risen from foundations of pure political power?=20
Prussia, the germ-cell of the Empire, came into being through=20
resplendent heroism and not through financial operations or=20
commercial deals, and the Reich itself in turn was only the=20
glorious reward of aggressive political leadership and the death-=20
defying courage of its soldiers. How could this very German=20
people have succumbed to such a sickening of its political instinct?=20
For here we face, not an isolated phenomenon, but forces of=20
decay which in truly terrifying number soon began to flare up=20
like will-o=E2=80=99-the-wisps, brushing up and down the body politic,=20
or eating like poisonous abscesses into the nation, now here and=20
now there. It seemed as though a continuous stream of poison=20
was being driven into the outermost blood-vessels of this once=20
heroic body by a mysterious power, and was inducing progres=C2=AC=20
sively greater paralysis of sound reason and the simple instinct of=20
self-preservation.=20

As innumerable times I passed in review all these questions,=20
arising through my position on the German alliance policy and=20
the economic policy of the Reich in the years 1912 to 1914 =E2=80=94 the=20
only remaining solution to the riddle became to an ever-increas=C2=AC=20
ing degree that power which, from an entirely different viewpoint,=20
I had come to know earlier in Vienna: the Marxist doctrine and=20
philosophy, and their organizational results.=20

For the second time I dug into this doctrine of destruction =E2=80=94=20
this time no longer led by the impressions and effects of my daily=20
associations, but directed by the observation of general processes=20
of political life. I again immersed myself in the theoretical lit=C2=AC=20
erature of this new world, attempting to achieve clarity concern=C2=AC=20
ing its possible effects, and then compared it with the actual=20
phenomena and events it brings about in political, cultural, and=20
economic life.=20

Now for the first time I turned my attention to the attempts=20
to master this world plague.=20



Germany=E2=80=99s Attitude Toward Marxism 155=20

I studied Bismarck=E2=80=99s Socialist legislation 1 in its intention,=20
struggle, and success. Gradually I obtained a positively granite=20
foundation for my own conviction, so that since that time I have=20
never been forced to undertake a shift in my own inner view on=20
this question. Likewise the relation of Marxism to the Jews was=20
submitted to further thorough examination.=20

Though previously in Vienna, Germany above all had seemed=20
to me an unshakable colossus, now anxious misgivings sometimes=20
entered my mind. In silent solitude and in the small circles of=20
my acquaintance, I was filled with wrath at German foreign=20
policy and likewise with what seemed to me the incredibly frivo=C2=AC=20
lous way in which the most important problem then existing for=20
Germany, Marxism, was treated. It was really beyond me how=20
people could rush so blindly into a danger whose effects, pursuant=20
to the Marxists=E2=80=99 own intention, were bound some day to be=20
monstrous. Even then, among my acquaintance, just as today=20
on a large scale, I warned against the phrase with which all=20
wretched cowards comfort themselves: =E2=80=98Nothing can happen to=20
us!=E2=80=99 This pestilential attitude had once been the downfall of a=20
gigantic empire. Could anyone believe that Germany alone was=20
not subject to exactly the same laws as all other human organ=C2=AC=20
isms?=20

In the years 1913 and 1914, I, for the first time in various=20
circles which today in part faithfully support the National=20
Socialist movement, expressed the conviction that the question=20
of the future of the German nation was the question of destroy=C2=AC=20
ing Marxism.=20

In the catastrophic German alliance policy I saw only one of=20
the consequences called forth by the disruptive work of this=20
doctrine; for the terrible part of it was that this poison almost=20
invisibly destroyed all the foundations of a healthy conception=20

1 Bismarck=E2=80=99s Anti-Socialist Law, put through the Reichstag on Octob=
er=20

Social Democrats, Socialists, and Communists; it remained in force until=20

Socialist deputies in the Reichstag retained their parliamentary immunity.=
=20

of economy and state, and that often those affected by it did not=20
themselves realize to what an extent their activities and desires=20
emanated from this philosophy which they otherwise sharply=20
rejected.=20

The internal decline of the German nation had long since=20
begun, yet, as so often in life, people had not achieved clarity=20
concerning the force that was destroying their existence. Some=C2=AC=20
times they tinkered around with the disease, but confused the=20
forms of the phenomenon with the virus that had caused it.=20
Since they did not know or want to know the cause, the struggle=20
against Marxism was no better than bungling quackery.=20

I Is A YOUNG SCAMP in my wild years,=20
nothing had so grieved me as having been born at a time which=20
obviously erected its Halls of Fame only to shopkeepers and=20
government officials. The waves of historic events seemed to=20
have grown so smooth that the future really seemed to belong=20
only to the =E2=80=98peaceful contest of nations=E2=80=99; in other words, =
a cozy=20
mutual swindling match with the exclusion of violent methods of=20
defense. The various nations began to be more and more like=20
private citizens who cut the ground from under one another=E2=80=99s feet,=
=20
stealing each other=E2=80=99s customers and orders, trying in every way=20
to get ahead of one another, and staging this whole act amid a=20
hue and cry as loud as it is harmless. This development seemed=20
not only to endure but was expected in time (as was universally=20
recommended) to remodel the whole world into one big depart=C2=AC=20
ment store in whose vestibules the busts of the shrewdest profi=C2=AC=20
teers and the most lamblike administrative officials would be=20
garnered for all eternity. The English could supply the mer=C2=AC=20

no doubt would have to sacrifice themselves to being the owmers,=20
since by their own admission they never make any money, but=20
always =E2=80=98pay,=E2=80=99 and, besides, speak the most languages.=20

Why couldn=E2=80=99t I have been born a hundred years earlier? Say=20
at the time of the Wars of Liberation when a man, even without=20
a =E2=80=98business,=E2=80=99 was really worth something?!=20


158=20


Mein Kampf=20


Thus I had often indulged in angry thoughts concerning my=20
earthly pilgrimage, which, as it seemed, to me, had begun too=20
late, and regarded the period =E2=80=98of law and order=E2=80=99 ahead of m=
e=20
as a mean and undeserved trick of Fate. Even as a boy I was no=20
=E2=80=98pacifist/ and all attempts to educate me in this direction came=20
to nothing.=20

The Boer War was like summer lightning to me.=20

Every day I waited impatiently for the newspapers and=20
devoured dispatches and news reports, happy at the privilege=20
of witnessing this heroic struggle even at a distance.=20

The Russo-Japanese War found me considerably more mature,=20
but also more attentive. More for national reasons I had al=C2=AC=20
ready taken sides, and in our little discussions at once sided with=20
the Japanese. In a defeat of the Russians I saw the defeat of=20
Austrian Slavdom.=20

Since then many years have passed, and what as a boy had=20
seemed to me a lingering disease, I now felt to be the quiet before=20
the storm. As early as my Vienna period, the Balkans were im=C2=AC=20
mersed in that livid sultriness which customarily announces the=20
hurricane, and from time to time a beam of brighter light flared=20
up, only to vanish again in the spectral darkness. But then came=20
the Balkan War and with it the first gust of wind swept across=20
a Europe grown nervous. The time which now followed lay on=20
the chests of men like a heavy nightmare, sultry as feverish=20
tropic heat, so that due to constant anxiety the sense of ap=C2=AC=20
proaching catastrophe turned at last to longing: let Heaven at=20
last give free rein to the fate which could no longer be thwarted.=20
And then the first mighty lightning flash struck the earth; the=20
storm was unleashed and with the thunder of Heaven there=20
mingled the roar of the World War batteries.=20

When the news of the murder of Archduke Francis Ferdinand=20
arrived in Munich (I happened to be sitting at home and heard=20
of it only vaguely), I was at first seized with worry that the bullets=20
may have been shot from the pistols of German students, who,=20
out of indignation at the heir apparent=E2=80=99s continuous work of=20
Slavization, wanted to free the German people from this internal=20


Greatest Friend of the Slavs Murdered 159=20


enemy. What the consequence of this would have been was=20
easy to imagine: a new wave of persecutions which would now=20
have been c justified=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98 explained ? in the eyes of the=
 whole=20
world. But when, soon afterward, I heard the names of the=20
supposed assassins, and moreover read that they had been iden=C2=AC=20
tified as Serbs, a light shudder began to run through me at this=20
vengeance of inscrutable Destiny.=20

The greatest friend of the Slavs had fallen beneath the bullets=20
of Slavic fanatics.=20

Anyone with constant occasion in the last years to observe=20
the relation of Austria to Serbia could not for a moment be in=20
doubt that a stone had been set rolling whose course could no=20
longer be arrested.=20

Those who today shower the Viennese government with re=C2=AC=20
proaches on the form and content of the ultimatum it issued, do=20
it an injustice. No other power in the world could have acted=20
differently in the same situation and the same position. At her=20
southeastern border Austria possessed an inexorable and mortal=20
enemy who at shorter and shorter intervals kept challenging the=20
monarchy and would never have left off until the moment favor=C2=AC=20
able for the shattering of the Empire had arrived. There was=20
reason to fear that this would occur at the latest with the death=20
of the old Emperor; by then perhaps the old monarchy would no=20
longer be in a position to offer any serious resistance. In the=20
last few years the state had been so bound up with the person=20
of Francis Joseph that the death of this old embodiment of=20
the Empire was felt by the broad masses to be tantamount to=20
the death of the Empire itself. Indeed, it was one of the craftiest=20
artifices, particularly of the Slavic policy, to create the appear=C2=AC=20
ance that the Austrian state no longer owed its existence to=20
anything but the miraculous and unique skill of this monarch;=20
this flattery was all the more welcome in the Hof burg, since it=20
corresponded not at all to the real merits of the Emperor. The=20
thorn hidden in these paeans of praise remained undiscovered.=20
The rulers did not see, or perhaps no longer wanted to see, that=20
the more the monarchy depended on the outstanding statecraft,=20


160=20


Mein Kampf=20


as they put it, of this =E2=80=98 wisest monarch=E2=80=99 of all times, the=
 more=20
catastrophic the situation was bound to,become if one day Fate=20
were to knock at his door, too, demanding its tribute.=20

Was old Austria even conceivable without the Emperor?!=20

Wouldn=E2=80=99t the tragedy which had once stricken Maria Theresa=20
have been repeated?=20

No, it is really doing the Vienna circles an injustice to reproach=20
them with rushing into a war which might otherwise have been=20
avoided. It no longer could be avoided, but at most could have=20
been postponed for one or two years. But this was the curse of=20
German as well as Austrian diplomacy, that it had always striven=20
to postpone the inevitable reckoning, until at length it was=20
forced to strike at the most unfavorable hour. We can be con=C2=AC=20
vinced that a further attempt to save peace would have brought=20
war at an even more unfavorable time.=20

No, those who did not want this war had to have the courage=20
to face the consequences, which could have consisted only in the=20
sacrifice of Austria. Even then the war would have come, but no=20
longer as a struggle of all against ourselves, but in the form of=20
a partition of the Habsburg monarchy. And then they had to=20
make up their minds to join in, or to look on with empty hands=20
and let Fate run its course.=20

Those very people, however, who today are loudest in cursing=20
the beginning of the war and offer the sagest opinions were those=20
who contributed most fatally to steering us into it.=20

For decades the Social Democrats had carried on the most=20
scoundrelly war agitation against Russia, and the Center for=20
religious reasons had been most active in making the Austrian=20
state the hinge and pivot of Germany policy. Now we had to=20
suffer the consequences of this lunacy. What came had to come,=20
and could no longer under any circumstances be avoided. The=20
guilt of the German government was that in order to preserve=20
peace it always missed the favorable hours for striking, became=20
entangled in the alliance for the preservation of world peace, and=20
thus finally became the victim of a world coalition which count=C2=AC=20
ered the idea of preserving world peace with nothing less than=20
determination for world war.=20


The Austrian Ultimatum=20


161=20


If the Vienna government had given the ultimatum another,=20
milder form, this would have changed nothing in the situation=20
except at most one thing, that this government would itself have=20
been swept away by the indignation of the people. For in the=20
eyes of the broad masses the tone of the ultimatum was far too=20
gentle and by no means too brutal, let alone too far-reaching,=20
Anyone who today attempts to argue this away is either a for-=20
getful blockhead or a perfectly conscious swindler and liar.=20

The struggle of the year 1914 was not forced on the masses =E2=80=94=20
no, by the living God =E2=80=94 it was desired by the whole people.=20

People wanted at length to put an end to the general uncer=C2=AC=20
tainty. Only thus can it be understood that more than two=20
million German men and boys thronged to the colors for this=20
hardest of all struggles, prepared to defend the flag with the last=20
drop of their blood.=20


TV* W=20

To me those hours seemed like a release from the painful feel=C2=AC=20
ings of my youth. Even today I am not ashamed to say that,=20
overpowered by stormy enthusiasm, I fell down on my knees=20
and thanked Heaven from an overflowing heart for granting me=20
the good fortune of being permitted to live at this time.=20

A fight for freedom had begun, mightier than the earth had=20
ever seen; for once Destiny had begun its course, the conviction=20
dawned on even the broad masses that this time not the fate of=20
Serbia or Austria was involved, but whether the German nation=20
was to be or not to be.=20

For the last time in many years the people had a prophetic=20
vision of its own future. Thus, right at the beginning of the=20
gigantic struggle the necessary grave undertone entered into the=20
ecstasy of an overflowing enthusiasm; for this knowledge alone=20
made the national uprising more than a mere blaze of straw.=20
The earnestness was only too necessary; for in those days people=20
in general had not the faintest conception of the possible length=20


162=20


Mein Kampf=20


and duration of the struggle that was now beginning. They=20
dreamed of being home again that winter to continue and renew=20
their peaceful labors.=20

What a man wants is what he hopes and believes. The over=C2=AC=20
whelming majority of the nation had long been weary of the=20
eternally uncertain state of affairs; thus it was only too under=C2=AC=20
standable that they no longer believed in a peaceful conclusion=20
of the Austro-Serbian conflict, but hoped for the final settlement.=20

I, too, was one of these millions.=20

Hardly had the news of the assassination become known in=20
Munich than at once two thoughts quivered through my brain:=20
first, that at last war would be inevitable; and, furthermore,=20
that now the Habsburg state would be compelled to keep its=20
pact; for what I had always most feared was the possibility that=20
Germany herself would some day, perhaps in consequence of=20
this very alliance, find herself in a conflict not directly caused by=20
Austria, so that the Austrian state for reasons of domestic policy=20
would not muster the force of decision to stand behind her ally.=20
The Slavic majority of the Empire would at once have begun=20
to sabotage any such intention on the part of the state, and=20
would always have preferred to smash the entire state to smither=C2=AC=20
eens than grant its ally the help it demanded. This danger was=20
now eliminated. The old state had to fight whether it wanted=20
to or not.=20

My own position on the conflict was likewise very simple and=20
clear; for me it was not that Austria was fighting for some Serbian=20
satisfaction, but that Germany was fighting for her existence,=20
the German nation for life or death, freedom and future. The=20
time had come for Bismarck=E2=80=99s work to fight; what the fathers=20
had once won in the battles from Weissenburg to Sedan and Paris,=20
young Germany now had to earn once more. If the struggle were=20
carried through to victory, our nation would enter the circle of=20
great nations from the standpoint of external power, and only=20
then could the German Reich maintain itself as a mighty haven=20
of peace without having, for the sake of peace, to cut down on=20
the daily bread of her children.=20


Enlistment in a Bavarian Regiment=20


163=20


As a boy and young man I had so often felt the desire to prove=20
at least once by deeds that for me national enthusiasm was no=20
empty whim. It often seemed to me almost a sin to shout hurrah=20
perhaps without having the inner right to do so; for who had=20
the right to use this word without having proved it in the place=20
where all playing is at an end and the inexorable hand of the=20
Goddess of Destiny begins to weigh peoples and men according=20
to the truth and steadfastness of their convictions? Thus my=20
heart, like that of a million others, overflowed with proud joy that=20
at last I would be able to redeem myself from this paralyzing=20
feeling. I had so often sung 1 Deutschland iiber Alles=E2=80=99 and shouted=
=20
=E2=80=98Hell=E2=80=99 at the top of my lungs, that it seemed to me almost =
a be=C2=AC=20
lated act of grace to be allowed to stand as a witness in the di=C2=AC=20
vine court of the eternal judge and proclaim the sincerity of this=20
conviction. For from the first hour I was convinced that in case=20
of a war =E2=80=94 which seemed to me inevitable =E2=80=94 in one way or an=
=C2=AC=20
other I would at once leave my books. Likewise I knew that=20
my place would then be where my inner voice directed me.=20

I had left Austria primarily for political reasons; what was=20
more natural than that, now the struggle had begun, I should=20
really begin to take account of this conviction. I did not want=20
to fight for the Habsburg state, but was ready at any time to=20
die for my people and for the Reich which embodied it.=20

On the third of August, I submitted a personal petition to=20
His Majesty, King Ludwig III, with a request for permission=20
to enter a Bavarian regiment. The cabinet office certainly had=20
plenty to do in those days; so much the greater was my joy to=20
receive an answer to my request the very next day. With trem=C2=AC=20
bling hands I opened the document; my request had been ap=C2=AC=20
proved and I was summoned to report to a Bavarian regiment.=20
My joy and gratitude knew no bounds. A few days later I was=20
wearing the tunic which I was not to doff until nearly six years=20
later.=20

For me, as for every German, there now began the greatest=20
and most unforgettable time of my earthly existence. Compared=20
to the events of this gigantic struggle, everything past receded=20


164=20


Mein Kampp=20


to shallow nothingness. Precisely in these days, with the tenth=20
anniversary of the mighty event approaching, I think back with=20
proud sadness on those first weeks of our people=E2=80=99s heroic struggle,=
=20
in which Fate graciously allowed me to take part.=20

As though it were yesterday, image after image passes before=20
my eyes. I see myself donning the uniform in the circle of my=20
dear comrades, turning out for the first time, drilling, etc., until=20
the day came for us to march off.=20

A single worry tormented me at that time, me, as so many=20
others: would we not reach the front too late? Time and time=20
again this alone banished all my calm. Thus, in every cause for=20
rejoicing at a new, heroic victory, a slight drop of bitterness was=20
hidden, for every new victory seemed to increase the danger of=20
our coming too late.=20

At last the day came when we left Munich to begin the ful=C2=AC=20
fillment of our duty. For the first time I saw the Rhine as we=20
rode westward along its quiet waters to defend it, the German=20
stream of streams, from the greed of the old enemy. When=20
through the tender veil of the early morning mist the Niederwald=20
Monument gleamed down upon us in the gentle first rays of the=20
sun, the old Watch on the Rhine roared out of the endless trans=C2=AC=20
port train into the morning sky, and I felt as though my heart=20
would burst.=20

And then came a damp, cold night in Flanders, through which=20
we marched in silence, and when the day began to emerge from=20
the mists, suddenly an iron greeting came whizzing at us over=20
our heads, and with a sharp report sent the little pellets flying=20
between our ranks, ripping up the wet ground; but even before=20
the little cloud had passed, from two hundred throats the first=20
hurrah rose to meet the first messenger of death. Then a crackling=20
and a roaring, a singing and a howling began, and with feverish=20
eyes each one of us was drawn forward, faster and faster, until=20
suddenly past turnip fields and hedges the fight began, the fight=20
of man against man. And from the distance the strains of a song=20
reached our ears, coming closer and closer, leaping from company=20
to company, and just as Death plunged a busy hand into our=20


From Young Volunteer to Old Soldier=20


165=20


ranks, the song reached us too and we passed it along: =E2=80=98Deutsch=C2=
=AC=20
land , Deutschland ilber Alles, ilber Alles in der Weltl=E2=80=99=20

Four days later we came back. Even our step had changed.=20
Seventeen-year-old boys now looked like men.=20

The volunteers of the List Regiment may not have learned to=20
fight properly, but they knew how to die like old soldiers.=20

This was the beginning.=20

Thus it went on year after year; but the romance of battle=20
had been replaced by horror. The enthusiasm gradually cooled=20
and the exuberant joy was stifled by mortal fear. The time came=20
when every man had to struggle between the instinct of self-=20
preservation and the admonitions of duty. I, too, was not spared=20
by this struggle. Always when Death was on the hunt, a vague=20
something tried to revolt, strove to represent itself to the weak=20
body as reason, yet it was only cowardice, which in such dis=C2=AC=20
guises tried to ensnare the individual. A grave tugging and warn=C2=AC=20
ing set in, and often it was only the last remnant of conscience=20
which decided the issue. Yet the more this voice admonished=20
one to caution, the louder and more insistent its lures, the sharper=20
resistance grew until at last, after a long inner struggle, con=C2=AC=20
sciousness of duty emerged victorious. By the winter of 1915-16,=20
this struggle had for me been decided. At last my will was un=C2=AC=20
disputed master. If in the first days I went over the top with=20
rejoicing and laughter, I was now calm and determined. And=20
this was enduring. Now Fate could bring on the ultimate tests=20
without my nerves shattering or my reason failing.=20

The young volunteer had become an old soldier.=20

And this transformation had occurred in the whole army. It=20
had issued old and hard from the eternal battles, and as for=20
those who could not stand up under the storm =E2=80=94 well, they were=20
broken.=20

Now was the time to judge this army. Now, after two or three=20
years, during which it was hurled from one battle into another,=20
forever fighting against superiority in numbers and weapons,=20
suffering hunger and bearing privations, now was the time to=20
test the quality of this unique army.=20


166=20


Mein Kampf=20


Thousands of years may pass, but never will it be possible to=20
speak of heroism without mentioning the German army and the=20
World War. Then from the veil of the past the iron front of the=20
gray steel helmet will emerge, unwavering and unflinching, an=20
immortal monument. As long as there are Germans alive, they=20
will remember that these men were sons of their nation.=20

I was a soldier then, and I didn=E2=80=99t want to talk about politics.=20
And really it was not the time for it. Even today I harbor the=20
conviction that the humblest wagon-driver performed more valu=C2=AC=20
able services for the fatherland than the foremost among, let us=20
say, *parliamentarians.=E2=80=99 I had never hated these big-mouths=20
more than now when every red-blooded man with something to=20
say yelled it into the enemy=E2=80=99s face or appropriately left his tongu=
e=20
at home and silently did his duty somewhere. Yes, in those days=20
I hated all those politicians. And if it had been up to me, a par=C2=AC=20
liamentary pick-and-shovel battalion would have been formed at=20
once; then they could have chewed the fat to their hearts=E2=80=99 con=C2=
=AC=20
tent without annoying, let alone harming, honest, decent people.=20

Thus, at that time I wanted to hear nothing of politics, but I=20
could not help taking a position on certain manifestations which=20
after all did affect the whole nation, and particularly concerned=20
us soldiers.=20

There were two things which then profoundly angered me and=20
which I regarded as harmful.=20

After the very first news of victories, a certain section of the=20
press, slowly, and in a way which at first was perhaps unrecog=C2=AC=20
nizable to many, began to pour a few drops of wormwood into=20
the general enthusiasm. This was done beneath the mask of a=20
certain benevolence and well-meaning, even of a certain solici=C2=AC=20
tude. They had misgivings about an excess of exuberance in=20
the celebration of the victories. They feared that in this form=20
it was unworthy of so great a nation and hence inappropriate.=20
The bravery and heroic courage of the German soldier were=20
something self-evident, they said, and people should not be=20
carried away too much by thoughtless outbursts of joy, if only=20
for the sake of foreign countries to whom a silent and dignified=20


Artificial Dampening of Enthusiasm=20


167=20


form of joy appealed more than unbridled exultation, etc.=20
Finally, we Germans even now should not forget that the war=20
was none of our intention and therefore we should not be ashamed=20
to confess in an open and manly fashion that at any time we=20
would contribute our part to a reconciliation of mankind. For=20
that reason it would not be prudent to besmirch the purity of=20
our army=E2=80=99s deeds by too much shouting, since the rest of the=20
world would have little understanding for such behavior. The=20
world admired nothing more than the modesty with which a=20
true hero silently and calmly forgets his deeds, for this was the=20
gist of the whole argument.=20

Instead of taking one of these creatures by his long ears, tying=20
him to a long pole and pulling him up on a long cord, thus making=20
it impossible for the cheering nation to insult the aesthetic senti=C2=AC=
=20
ment of this knight of the inkpot, the authorities actually began=20
to issue remonstrances against =E2=80=98 unseemly =E2=80=99 rejoicing over =
victories.=20

It didn=E2=80=99t occur to them in the least that enthusiasm once=20
scotched cannot be reawakened at need. It is an intoxication=20
and must be preserved in this state. And how, without this=20
power of enthusiasm, should a country withstand a struggle which=20
in all likelihood would make the most enormous demands on the=20
spiritual qualities of the nation?.=20

I knew the psyche of the broad masses too well not to be aware=20
that a high =E2=80=98aesthetic=E2=80=99 tone would not stir up the fire tha=
t was=20
necessary to keep the iron hot. In my eyes it was madness=20
on the part of the authorities to be doing nothing to intensify=20
the glowing heat of passion; and when they curtailed what=20
passion was fortunately present, that was absolutely beyond me.=20

The second thing that angered me was the attitude which=20
they thought fit to take toward Marxism. In my eyes, this only=20
proved that they hadn=E2=80=99t so much as the faintest idea concerning=20
this pestilence. In all seriousness they seemed to believe that,=20
by the assurance that parties were no longer recognized, they=20
had brought Marxism to understanding and restraint.=20

They failed to understand that here no party was involved,=20
but a doctrine that must lead to the destruction of all humanity,=20


168=20


Mein Kampf=20


especially since this cannot be learned in the Jewified universi=C2=AC=20
ties and, besides, so many, particularly among our higher offi=C2=AC=20
cials, due to the idiotic conceit that is cultivated in them, don=E2=80=99t=
=20
think it worth the trouble to pick up a book and learn something=20
which was not in their university curriculum. The most gigantic-=20
upheaval passes these =E2=80=98minds=E2=80=99 by without leaving the slight=
est=20
trace, which is why state institutions for the most part lag be=C2=AC=20
hind private ones. It is to them, by God, that the popular proverb=20
best applies: =E2=80=98What the peasant doesn=E2=80=99t know, he won=E2=80=
=99t eat.=E2=80=99=20
Here, too, a few exceptions only confirm the rule.=20

It was an unequaled absurdity to identify the German worker=20
with Marxism in the days of August, 1914. In those hours the=20
German worker had made himself free from the embrace of this=20
venomous plague, for otherwise he would never have been able=20
to enter the struggle. The authorities, however, were stupid=20
enough to believe that Marxism had now become =E2=80=98national=E2=80=99;=
=20
a flash of genius which only shows that in these long years none=20
of these official guides of the state had even taken the trouble=20
to study the essence of this doctrine, for if they had, such an=20
absurdity could scarcely have crept in.=20

Marxism, whose goal is and remains the destruction of all=20
non-Jew T ish national states, was forced to look on in horror as,=20
in the July days of 1914, the German working class it had en=C2=AC=20
snared, awakened and from hour to hour began to enter the=20
service of the fatherland with ever-increasing rapidity. In a=20
few days the whole mist and swindle of this infamous betrayal=20
of the people had scattered away, and suddenly the gang of=20
Jewish leaders stood there lonely and forsaken, as though not a=20
trace remained of the nonsense and madness which for sixty=20
years they had been funneling into the masses. It was a bad=20
moment for the betrayers of the German working class, but as=20
soon as the leaders recognized the danger which menaced them,=20
they rapidly pulled the tarn-cap 1 of lies over their ears, and=20
insolently mimicked the national awakening.=20

1 Tarn-cap: a cloak conferring invisibility. Occurs frequently in German=20
legends. Siegfried used one in his battle with Brunhilde.=20


Use of Naked Force=20


169=20


But now the time had come to take steps against the whole=20
treacherous brotherhood of these Jewish poisoners of the people.=20
Now was the time to deal with them summarily without the=20
slightest consideration for any screams and complaints that=20
might arise. In August, 1914, the whole Jewish jabber about=20
international solidarity had vanished at one stroke from the=20
heads of the German working class, and in its stead, only a few=20
weeks later, American shrapnel began to pour down the blessings=20
of brotherhood on the helmets of our march columns. It would=20
have been the duty of a serious government, now that the=20
German worker had found his way back to his nation, to ex=C2=AC=20
terminate mercilessly the agitators who were misleading the=20
nation.=20

If the best men were dying at the front, the least we could do=20
was to wipe out the vermin.=20

Instead of this, His Majesty the Kaiser himself stretched out=20
his hand to the old criminals, thus sparing the treacherous mur=C2=AC=20
derers of the nation and giving them a chance to retrieve them=C2=AC=20
selves.=20

So now the viper could continue his work, more cautiously=20
than before, but all the more dangerously. While the honest=20
ones were dreaming of peace within their borders, 1 the perjuring=20
criminals were organizing the revolution.=20

That such terrible half-measures should then be decided upon=20
made me more and more dissatisfied at heart; but at that time I=20
would not have thought it possible that the end of it all would=20
be so frightful.=20

What, then, should have been done? The leaders of the whole=20
movement should at once have been put behind bars, brought=20
to trial, and thus taken off the nation=E2=80=99s neck. All the implements=
=20
of military power should have been ruthlessly used for the ex=C2=AC=20
termination of this pestilence. The parties should have been=20
dissolved, the Reichstag brought to its senses, with bayonets if=20
necessary, but, best of all, dissolved at once. Just as the Re-=20

1 Burgfrieden, the special legal protection accorded to walled places and=
=20
cities in the Middle Ages.=20


170=20


Mein Kampf=20


public today can dissolve parties, this method should have been=20
used at that time, with more reason. For the life and death of=20
a whole nation was at stake!=20

One question came to the fore, however: can spiritual ideas=20
be exterminated by the sword? Can =E2=80=98 philosophies=E2=80=99 be com=C2=
=AC=20
bated by the use of brute force?=20

Even at that time I pondered this question more than once:=20

If we ponder analogous cases, particularly on a religious basis,=20
which can be found in history, the following fundamental prin=C2=AC=20
ciple emerges:=20

Conceptions and ideas, as well as movements with a definite=20
spiritual foundation, regardless whether the latter is false or=20
true, can, after a certain point in their development, only be=20
broken with technical instruments of power if these physical=20
weapons are at the same time the support of a new kindling=20
thought, idea, or philosophy.=20

The application of force alone, without the impetus of a basic=20
spiritual idea as a starting point, can never lead to the destruc=C2=AC=20
tion of an idea and its dissemination, except in the form of a=20
complete extermination of even the very last exponent of the=20
idea and the destruction of the last tradition. This, however,=20
usually mea,ns the disappearance of such a state from the sphere=20
of political importance, often for an indefinite time and some=C2=AC=20
times forever; for experience shows that such a blood sacrifice=20
strikes the best part of the people, since every persecution which=20
occurs without a spiritual basis seems morally unjustified and=20
whips up precisely the more valuable parts of a people in pro=C2=AC=20
test, which results in an adoption of the spiritual content of the=20
unjustly persecuted movement. In many this occurs simply=20
through a feeling of opposition against the attempt to bludgeon=20
down an idea by brute force.=20

As a result, the number of inward supporters grows in propor=C2=AC=20
tion as the persecution increases. Consequently, the complete=20
annihilation of the new doctrine can be carried out only through=20
a process of extermination so great and constantly increasing=20
that in the end all the truly valuable blood is drawn out of the=20


Use of Naked Force=20


171=20


people or state in question. The consequence is that, though a=20
so-called 1 inner =E2=80=99 purge can now take place, it will only be at th=
e=20
cost of total impotence. Such a method will always prove vain=20
in advance if the doctrine to be combated has overstepped a=20
certain small circle.=20

Consequently, here, too, as in all growth, the first period of=20
childhood is most readily susceptible to the possibility of ex=C2=AC=20
termination, while with the mounting years the power of re=C2=AC=20
sistance increases and only with the weakness of approaching old=20
age cedes again to new youth, though in another form and for=20
different reasons.=20

Indeed, nearly all attempts to exterminate a doctrine and its=20
organizational expression, by force without spiritual foundation,=20
are doomed to failure, and not seldom end with the exact opposite=20
of the desired result for the following reason:=20

The very first requirement for a mode of struggle with the=20
weapons of naked force is and remains persistence. In other=20
words: only the continuous and steady application of the methods=20
for repressing a doctrine, etc., makes it possible for a plan to=20
succeed. But as soon as force wavers and alternates with for=C2=AC=20
bearance, not only will the doctrine to be repressed recover again=20
and again, but it will also be in a position to draw new benefit=20
from every persecution, since, after such a wave of pressure has=20
ebbed away, indignation over the suffering induced leads new=20
supporters to the old doctrine, while the old ones will cling to it=20
with greater defiance and deeper hatred than before, and even=20
schismatic heretics, once the danger has subsided, will attempt=20
to return to their old viewpoint. Only in the steady and con=C2=AC=20
stant application of force lies the very first prerequisite for suc=C2=AC=
=20
cess. This persistence, however, can always and only arise from=20
a definite spiritual conviction. Any violence which does not=20
spring from a firm, spiritual base, will be wavering and uncertain.=20
It lacks the stability which can only rest in a fanatical outlook.=20
It emanates from the momentary energy and brutal determina=C2=AC=20
tion of an individual, and is therefore subject to the change of=20
personalities and to their nature and strength.=20


172=20


Mein Kampf=20


Added to this there is something else:=20

Any philosophy, whether of a religious or political nature =E2=80=94=20
and sometimes the dividing line is hard to determine =E2=80=94 fights=20
less for the negative destruction of the opposing ideology than=20
for the positive promotion of its own. Hence its struggle is less=20
defensive than offensive. It therefore has the advantage even in=20
determining the goal, since this goal represents the victory of its=20
own idea, while, conversely, it is hard to determine when the=20
negative aim of the destruction of a hostile doctrine may be=20
regarded as achieved and assured. For this reason alone, the=20
philosophy=E2=80=99s offensive will be more systematic and also more=20
powerful than the defensive against a philosophy, since here, too,=20
as always, the attack and not the defense makes the deci=C2=AC=20
sion. The fight against a spiritual power with methods of=20
violence remains defensive, however, until the sword becomes=20
the support, the herald and disseminator, of a new spiritual doc=C2=AC=20
trine.=20

Thus, in summing up, we can establish the following:=20

Any attempt to combat a philosophy with methods of violence=20
will fail in the end, unless the fight takes the form of attack for=20
a new spiritual attitude. Only in the struggle between two=20
philosophies can the weapon of brutal force, persistently and=20
ruthlessly applied, lead to a decision for the side it supports.=20

This remained the reason for the failure of the struggle against=20
Marxism.=20

This was why Bismarck=E2=80=99s Socialist legislation finally failed and=20
had to fail, in spite of everything. Lacking was the platform of a=20
new philosophy for whose rise the fight could have been waged.=20
For only the proverbial wisdom of high government officials will=20
succeed in believing that drivel about so-called =E2=80=98 state authority =
=E2=80=99=20
or Taw and order=E2=80=99 could form a suitable basis for the spiritual=20
impetus of a life-and-death struggle.=20

Since a real spiritual basis for this struggle was lacking,=20
Bismarck had to entrust the execution of his Socialist legislation=20
to the judgment and desires of that institution which itself was a=20
product of Marxist thinking. By entrusting the fate of his war=20


Bourgeois Class Parties=20


173=20


on the Marxists to the well-wishing of bourgeois democracy, the=20
Iron Chancellor set the wolf to mind the sheep.=20

All this was only the necessary consequence of the absence cf=20
a basic new anti-Marxist philosophy endowed with a stormy will=20
to conquer.=20

Hence the sole result of Bismarck=E2=80=99s struggle was a grave dis=C2=AC=
=20
illusionment.=20

Were conditions different during the World War or at its=20
beginning? Unfortunately not.=20

The more I occupied myself with the idea of a necessary change=20
in the government=E2=80=99s attitude toward Social Democracy as the=20
momentary embodiment of Marxism, the more I recognized the=20
lack of a serviceable substitute for this doctrine. What would=20
be given the masses, if, just supposing, Social Democracy had=20
been broken? There was not one movement in existence which=20
could have been expected to succeed in drawing into its sphere=20
of influence the great multitudes of workers grown more or less=20
leaderless. It is senseless and more than stupid to believe that=20
the international fanatic who had left the class party would=20
now at once join a bourgeois party, in other words, a new class=20
organization. For, unpleasant as it may seem to various organ=C2=AC=20
izations, it cannot be denied that bourgeois politicians largely=20
take class division quite for granted as long as it does not begin=20
to work out to their political disadvantage.=20

The denial of this fact only proves the effrontery, and also the=20
stupidity, of the liars.=20

Altogether, care should be taken not to regard the masses as=20
stupider than they are. In political matters feeling often decides=20
more correctly than reason. The opinion that the stupid inter=C2=AC=20
national attitude of the masses is sufficient proof of the unsound=C2=AC=20
ness of the masses=E2=80=99 sentiments can be thoroughly confuted by=20
the simple reminder that pacifist democracy is no less insane,=20
and that its exponents originate almost exclusively in the bour=C2=AC=20
geois camp. As long as millions of the bourgeoisie still piously=20
worship their Jewish democratic press every morning, it very ill=20
becomes these gentlemen to make jokes about the stupidity of=20


174=20


Mein Kampf=20


the =E2=80=98 comrade =E2=80=99 who, in the last analysis, only swallows do=
wn the=20
same garbage, though in a different form. In both cases the=20
manufacturer is one and the same Jew.=20

Good care should be taken not to deny things that just happen=20
to be true. The fact that the class question is by no means=20
exclusively a matter of ideal problems, as, particularly before=20
the elections, some people would like to pretend, cannot be denied.=20
The class arrogance of a large part of our people, and to an even=20
greater extent, the underestimation of the manual worker, are=20
phenomena which do not exist only in the imagination of the=20
moonstruck.=20

Quite aside from this, however, it shows the small capacity=20
for thought of our so-called =E2=80=98intelligentsia=E2=80=99 when, particu=
larly=20
in these circles, it is not understood that a state of affairs which=20
could not prevent the growth of a plague, such as Marxism hap=C2=AC=20
pens to be, will certainly not be able to recover what has been=20
lost.=20

The =E2=80=98bourgeois=E2=80=99 parties, as they designate themselves, will=
=20
never be able to attach the =E2=80=98proletarian=E2=80=99 masses to their c=
amp,=20
for here two worlds oppose each other, in part naturally and in=20
part artificially divided, whose mutual relation 1 can only be=20
struggle. The younger will be victorious =E2=80=94 and this is Marxism.=20

Indeed, a struggle against Social Democracy in the year 1914=20
was conceivable, but how long this condition would be main=C2=AC=20
tained, in view of the absence of any substitute, remained doubt=C2=AC=20
ful.=20

Here there was a great gap.=20

I was of this opinion long before the War, and for this reason=20
could not make up my mind to join one of the existing parties.=20
In the course of events of the World War, I was reinforced in=20
this opinion by the obvious impossibility of taking up a ruthless=20
struggle against Social Democracy, owing to this very lack of a=20
movement which would have had to be more than a =E2=80=98 parliamen=C2=AC=

With my closer comrades I often expressed myself openly on=20

And now the first ideas came to me of later engaging in politi=C2=AC=20

Precisely this was what caused me often to assure the small=20
circle of my friends that after the War, I meant to be a speaker in=20
addition to my profession.=20

I believe that I was very serious about this.=20


CHAPTER=20

Vi=20


War Propaganda=20


b vvft? since I have been scrutinizing politi-=20
cal events, I have taken a tremendous interest in propagandist=20
activity. I saw that the Socialist-Marxist organizations mastered=20
and applied this instrument with astounding skill. And I soon=20
realized that the correct use of propaganda is a true art which=20
has remained practically unknown to the bourgeois parties.=20
Only the Christian-Social movement, especially in Lueger=E2=80=99s time,=20
achieved a certain virtuosity on this instrument, to which it=20
owed many of its successes.=20

But it was not until the War that it became evident what=20
immense results could be obtained by a correct application of=20
propaganda. Here again, unfortunately, all our studying had to=20
be done on the enemy side, for the activity on our side was=20
modest, to say the least. The total miscarriage of the German=20
1 enlightenment=E2=80=99 service stared every soldier in the face, and this=
=20
spurred me to take up the question of propaganda even more=20
deeply than before.=20

There was often more than enough time for thinking, and the=20
enemy offered practical instruction which, to our sorrow, was=20
only too good.=20

For what we failed to do, the enemy did, with amazing skill=20
and really brilliant calculation. I, myself, learned enormously=20
from this enemy war propaganda. But time passed and left=20
no trace in the minds of all those who should have benefited;=20


Propaganda =E2=80=94 A Means=20


177=20


partly because they considered themselves too clever to learn=20
from the enemy, partly owing to lack of good will.=20

Did we have anything you could call propaganda?=20

I regret that I must answer in the negative. Everything that=20
actually was done in this field was so inadequate and wrong=20
from the very start that it certainly did no good and sometimes=20
did actual harm.=20

The form was inadequate, the substance was psychologically=20
wrong: a careful examination of German war propaganda can=20
lead to no other diagnosis.=20

There seems to have been no clarity on the very first question:=20
Is propaganda a means or an end?=20

It is a means and must therefore be judged with regard to its=20
end. It must consequently take a form calculated to support the=20
aim which it serves. It is also obvious that its aim can vary in=20
importance from the standpoint of general need, and that the=20
inner value of the propaganda will vary accordingly. The aim=20
for which we were fighting the War was the loftiest, the most=20
overpowering, that man can conceive: it was the freedom and=20
independence of our nation, the security of our future food sup=C2=AC=20
ply, and =E2=80=94 our national honor; a thing which, despite all con=C2=AC=
=20
trary opinions prevailing today, nevertheless exists, or rather=20
should exist, since peoples without honor have sooner or later=20
lost their freedom and independence, which in turn is only the=20
result of a higher justice, since generations of rabble without=20
honor deserve no freedom. Any man who wants to be a cowardly=20
slave can have no honor, or honor itself would soon fall into=20
general contempt.=20

The German nation was engaged in a struggle for a human=20
existence, and the purpose of war propaganda should have been=20
to support this struggle; its aim to help bring about victory.=20

When the nations on this planet fight for existence =E2=80=94 when=20
the question of destiny, To be or not to be,=E2=80=99 cries out for a solu=
=C2=AC=20
tion =E2=80=94 then all considerations of humanitarianism or aesthetics=20
crumble into nothingness; for all these concepts do not float=20
about in the ether, they arise from man=E2=80=99s imagination and are=20


178=20


Mein Kampf=20


bound up with man. When he departs from this world, these con=C2=AC=20
cepts are again dissolved into nothingness, for Nature does not=20
know them. And even among mankind, they belong only to a=20
few nations or rather races, and this in proportion as they=20
emanate from the feeling of the nation or race in question.=20
Humanitarianism and aesthetics would vanish even from a=20
world inhabited by man if this world were to lose the races that=20
have created and upheld these concepts.=20

But all such concepts become secondary when a nation is fight=C2=AC=20
ing for its existence; in fact, they become totally irrelevant to=20
the forms of the struggle as soon as a situation arises where they=20
might paralyze a struggling nation=E2=80=99s power of self-preservation.=20
And that has always been their only visible result.=20

As for humanitarianism, Moltke 1 said years ago that in war it=20
lies in the brevity of the operation, and that means that the=20
most aggressive fighting technique is the most humane.=20

But when people try to approach these questions with drivel=20
about aesthetics, etc., really only one answer is possible: where=20
the destiny and existence of a people are at stake, all obligation=20
toward beauty ceases. The most unbeautiful thing there can be=20
in human life is and remains the yoke of slavery. Or do these=20
Schwabing 2 decadents view the present lot of the German people=20
as =E2=80=98 aesthetic=E2=80=99? Certainly we don=E2=80=99t have to discuss=
 these matters=20
with the Jews, the most modern inventors of this cultural per=C2=AC=20
fume. Their whole existence is an embodied protest against the=20
aesthetics of the Lord=E2=80=99s image.=20

And since these criteria of humanitarianism and beauty must=20
be eliminated from the struggle, they are also inapplicable to=20
propaganda.=20

Propaganda in the War was a means to an end, and the end=20
was the struggle for the existence of the German people; conse=C2=AC=20
quently, propaganda could only be considered in accordance with=20

1 General Helmuth von Moltke (1800-91) became chief of the Prussian=20
General Staff in 1859. He modernized the Prussian army and was the=20
founder of the German General Staff.=20

' 2 Schwabing: the bohemian quarter of Munich, located near the university.=
=20


Propaganda Only for the Masses=20


179=20


the principles that were valid for this struggle. In this case the=20
most cruel weapons were humane if they brought about a quicker=20
victory; and only those methods were beautiful which helped the=20
nation to safeguard the dignity of its freedom.=20

This was the only possible attitude toward war propaganda in=20
a life-and-death struggle like ours.=20

If the so-called responsible authorities had been clear on this=20
point, they would never have fallen into such uncertainty over=20
the form and application of this weapon: for even propaganda is=20
no more than a weapon, though a frightful one in the hand of=20
an expert.=20

The second really decisive question was this: To whom should=20
propaganda be addressed? To the scientifically trained intelli=C2=AC=20
gentsia or to the less educated masses?=20

It must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses.=20

What the intelligentsia =E2=80=94 or those who today unfortunately=20
often go by that name =E2=80=94 what they need is not propaganda but=20
scientific instruction. The content of propaganda is not science=20
any more than the object represented in a poster is art. The=20
art of the poster lies in the designer=E2=80=99s ability to attract the att=
en=C2=AC=20
tion of the crowd by form and color. A poster advertising an art=20
exhibit must direct the attention of the public to the art being=20
exhibited; the better it succeeds in this, the greater is the art of=20
the poster itself. The poster should give the masses an idea of=20
the significance of the exhibition, it should not be a substitute=20
for the art on display. Anyone who wants to concern himself=20
with the art itself must do more than study the poster; and it=20
will not be enough for him just to saunter through the exhibi=C2=AC=20
tion. We may expect him to examine and immerse himself in=20
the individual works, and thus little by little form a fair opinion.=20

A similar situation prevails with what we today call propa=C2=AC=20
ganda.=20

The function of propaganda does not lie in the scientific train=C2=AC=20
ing of the individual, but in calling the masses=E2=80=99 attention to=20
certain facts, processes, necessities, etc., whose significance is=20
thus for the first time placed within their field of vision.=20


180=20


Mein Kampf=20


The whole art consists in doing this so skillfully that everyone=20
will be convinced that the fact is real, the process necessary, the=20
necessity correct, etc. But since propaganda is not and cannot=20
be the necessity in itself, since its function, like the poster, con=C2=AC=
=20
sists in attracting the attention of the crowd, and not in educat=C2=AC=20
ing those who are already educated or who are striving after=20
education and knowledge, its effect for the most part must be=20
aimed at the emotions and only to a very limited degree at the=20
so-called intellect.=20

All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must=20
be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is=20
addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended=20
to reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be.=20
But if, as in propaganda for sticking out a war, the aim is to=20
influence a whole people, we must avoid excessive intellectual=20
demands on our public, and too much caution cannot be exerted=20
in this direction.=20

The more modest its intellectual ballast, the more exclusively=20
it takes into consideration the emotions of the masses, the more=20
effective it will be. And this is the best proof of the soundness or=20
unsoundness of a propaganda campaign, and not success in=20
pleasing a few scholars or young aesthetes.=20

The art of propaganda lies in understanding the emotional=20
ideas of the great masses and finding, through a psychologically=20
correct form, the way to the attention and thence to the heart of=20
the broad masses. The fact that our bright boys do not under=C2=AC=20
stand this merely shows how mentally lazy and conceited they=20
are.=20

Once we understand how necessary it is for propaganda to be=20
adjusted to the broad mass, the following rule results:=20

It is a mistake to make propaganda many-sided, like scientific=20
instruction, for instance.=20

The receptivity of the great masses is very limited, their in=C2=AC=20
telligence is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous.=20
In consequence of these facts, all effective propaganda must be=20
limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans=20


Psychology of Propaganda=20


181=20


until the last member of the public understands what you want=20
him to understand by your slogan. As soon as you sacrifice this=20
slogan and try to be many-sided, the effect will piddle away, for=20
the crowd can neither digest nor retain the material offered. In=20
this way the result is weakened and in the end entirely can=C2=AC=20
celled out.=20

Thus we see that propaganda must follow a simple line and cor=C2=AC=20
respondingly the basic tactics must be psychologically sound.=20

For instance, it was absolutely wrong to make the enemy ridicu=C2=AC=20
lous, as the Austrian and German comic papers did. It was=20
absolutely wrong because actual contact with an enemy soldier=20
was bound to arouse an entirely different conviction, and the=20
results were devastating; for now the German soldier, under the=20
direct impression of the enemy=E2=80=99s resistance, felt himself swindled=
=20
by his propaganda service. His desire to fight, or even to stand=20
firm, was not strengthened, but the opposite occurred. His=20
courage flagged.=20

By contrast, the war propaganda of the English and Americans=20
was psychologically sound. By representing the Germans to=20
their own people as barbarians and Huns, they prepared the in=C2=AC=20
dividual soldier for the terrors of war, and thus helped to preserve=20
him from disappointments. After this, the most terrible weapon=20
that was used against him seemed only to confirm what his=20
propagandists had told him; it likewise reinforced his faith in=20
the truth of his government=E2=80=99s assertions, while on the other=20
hand it increased his rage and hatred against the vile enemy.=20
For the cruel effects of the weapon, whose use by the enemy he=20
now came to know, gradually came to confirm for him the =E2=80=98 Hun-=20
nish=E2=80=99 brutality of the barbarous enemy, which he had heard all=20
about; and it never dawned on him for a moment that his own=20
weapons possibly, if not probably, might be even more terrible=20
in their effects.=20

And so the English soldier could never feel that he had been=20
misinformed by his own countrymen, as unhappily was so much=20
the case with the German soldier that in the end he rejected=20
everything coming from this source as =E2=80=98swindles=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=
=98bunk.=E2=80=99=20


182=20


&gt;=20


Mein Kampf=20


All this resulted from the idea that any old simpleton (or even=20
somebody who was intelligent =E2=80=98 in other things =E2=80=99) could be =
assigned=20
to propaganda work, and the failure to realize that the most=20
brilliant psychologists would have been none too good.=20

And so the German war propaganda offered an unparalleled=20
example of an =E2=80=98 enlightenment =E2=80=99 service working in reverse,=
 since=20
any correct psychology was totally lacking.=20

There was no end to what could be learned from the enemy by=20
a man who kept his eyes open, refused to let his perceptions be=20
ossified, and for four and a half years privately turned the storm-=20
flood of enemy propaganda over in his brain.=20

What our authorities least of all understood was the very=20
first axiom of all propagandist activity: to wit, the basically=20
subjective and one-sided attitude it must take toward every=20
question it deals with. In this connection, from the very begin=C2=AC=20
ning of the War and from top to bottom, such sins were com=C2=AC=20
mitted that we were entitled to doubt whether so much absurdity=20
could really be attributed to pure stupidity alone.=20

What, for example, would we say about a poster that was=20
supposed to advertise a new soap and that described other soaps=20
as =E2=80=98good=E2=80=99?=20

We would only shake our heads.=20

Exactly the same applies to political advertising.=20

The function of propaganda is, for example, not to weigh and=20
ponder the rights of different people, but exclusively to em=C2=AC=20
phasize the one right which it has set out to argue for. Its task=20
is not to make an objective study of the truth, in so far as it=20
favors the enemy, and then set it before the masses with aca=C2=AC=20
demic fairness; its task is to serve our own right, always and=20
unflinchingly.=20

It was absolutely wrong to discuss war-guilt from the stand=C2=AC=20
point that Germany alone could not be held responsible for the=20
outbreak of the catastrophe; it would have been correct to load=20
every bit of the blame on the shoulders of the enemy, even if=20
this had not really corresponded to the true facts, as it actually=20
did.=20


)=20


The German Mania for Objectivity=20


183=20


And what was the consequence of this half-heartedness?=20

The broad mass of a nation does not consist of diplomats, or=20
even professors of political law, or even individuals capable of=20
forming a rational opinion; it consists of plain mortals, wavering=20
and inclined to doubt and uncertainty. As soon as our own=20
propaganda admits so much as a glimmer of right on the other=20
side, the foundation for doubt in our own right has been laid.=20
The masses are then in no position to distinguish where for=C2=AC=20
eign injustice ends and our own begins. In such a case they be=C2=AC=20
come uncertain and suspicious, especially if the enemy refrains=20
from going in for the same nonsense, but unloads every bit=20
of blame on his adversary. Isn=E2=80=99t it perfectly understandable that=
=20
the whole country ends up by lending more credence to enemy=20
propaganda, which is more unified and coherent, than to its own?=20
And particularly a people that suffers from the mania of objec=C2=AC=20
tivity as much as the Germans. For, after all this, everyone will=20
take the greatest pains to avoid doing the enemy any injustice,=20
even at the peril of seriously besmirching and even destroying=20
his own people and country.=20

Of course, this was not the intent of the responsible authorities,=20
but the people never realize that.=20

The people in their overwhelming majority are so feminine by=20
nature and attitude that sober reasoning determines their=20
thoughts and actions far less than emotion and feeling.=20

And this sentiment is not complicated, but very simple and=20
all of a piece. It does not have multiple shadings; it has a posi=C2=AC=20
tive and a negative; love or hate, right or wrong, truth or lie,=20
never half this way and half that way, never partially, or that=20
kind of thing.=20

English propagandists understood all this most brilliantly =E2=80=94=20
and acted accordingly. They made no half statements that=20
might have given rise to doubts.=20

Their brilliant knowledge of the primitive sentiments of the=20
broad masses is shown by their atrocity propaganda, which was=20
adapted to this condition. As ruthless as it was brilliant, it=20
created the preconditions for moral steadfastness at the front,=20


184=20


Mein Kampf=20


even in the face of the greatest actual defeats, and just as strik=C2=AC=20
ingly it pilloried the German enemy as the sole guilty party for=20
the outbreak of the War: the rabid, impudent bias and persist=C2=AC=20
ence with which this lie was expressed took into account the=20
emotional, always extreme, attitude of the great masses and for=20
this reason was believed.=20

How effective this type of propaganda was is most strikingly=20
shown by the fact that after four years of war it not only enabled=20
the enemy to stick to its guns, but even began to nibble at our=20
own people.=20

It need not surprise us that our propaganda did not enjoy this=20
success. In its inner ambiguity alone, it bore the germ of ineffec=C2=AC=20
tualness. And finally its content was such that it was very un=C2=AC=20
likely to make the necessary impression on the masses. Only=20
our feather-brained =E2=80=98statesmen=E2=80=99 could have dared to hope th=
at=20
this insipid pacifistic bilge could fire men=E2=80=99s spirits till they we=
re=20
willing to die.=20

As a result, their miserable stuff 1 was useless, even harmful=20

&lt;r.=20

in fact.=20

But the most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no=20
success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind con=C2=AC=20
stantly and with unflagging attention. It must confine itself to=20
a few points and repeat them over and over. Here, as so often=20
in this world, persistence is the first and most important require=C2=AC=20
ment for success.=20

Particularly in the field of propaganda, we must never let=20
ourselves be led by aesthetes or people who have grown blase:=20
not by the former, because the form and expression of our propa=C2=AC=20
ganda would soon, instead of being suitable for the masses, have=20
drawing power only for literary teas; and of the second we must=20
beware, because, lacking in any fresh emotion of their own, they=20
are always on the lookout for new stimulation. These people=20
are quick to weary of everything; they want variety, and they=20
are never able to feel or understand the needs of their fellow men=20
who are not yet so callous. They are always the first to criticize=20

a propaganda campaign, or rather its content, which seems to=20
them too old-fashioned, too hackneyed, too out-of-date, etc.=20
They are always after novelty, in search of a change, and this=20
makes them mortal enemies of any effective political propaganda.=20
For as soon as the organization and the content of propaganda=20
begin to suit their tastes, it loses all cohesion and evaporates=20
completely.=20

The purpose of propaganda is not to provide interesting dis=C2=AC=20
traction for blase young gentlemen, but to convince, and what I=20
mean is to convince the masses. But the masses are slow-moving,=20
and they always require a certain time before they are ready=20
even to notice a thing, and only after the simplest ideas are re=C2=AC=20
peated thousands of times will the masses finally remember=20
them.=20

When there is a change, it must not alter the content of what=20
the propaganda is driving at, but in the end must always say=20
the same thing. For instance, a slogan must be presented from=20
different angles, but the end of all remarks must always and im=C2=AC=20
mutably be the slogan itself. Only in this way can the propa=C2=AC=20
ganda have a unified and complete effect.=20

This broadness of outline from which we must never depart,=20
in combination with steady, consistent emphasis, allows our final=20
success to mature. And then, to our amazement, we shall see=20
what tremendous results such perseverance leads to =E2=80=94 to results=20
that are almost beyond our understanding.=20

All advertising, whether in the field of business or politics,=20
achieves success through the continuity and sustained uniformity=20
of its application.=20

Here, too, the example of enemy war propaganda was typical;=20
limited to a few points, devised exclusively for the masses, car=C2=AC=20
ried on with indefatigable persistence. Once the basic ideas=20
and methods of execution were recognized as correct, they were=20
applied throughout the whole War without the slightest change.=20
At first the claims of the propaganda were so impudent that=20
people thought it insane; later, it got on people=E2=80=99s nerves; and in=
=20
the end, it was believed. After four and a half years, a revolution=20


186=20


Mein Kampf=20


broke out in Germany; and its slogans originated in the enemy's-=20
war propaganda.=20

And in England they understood one more thing: that this=20
spiritual weapon can succeed only if it is applied on a tremendous=20
scale, but that success amply covers all costs.=20

There, propaganda was regarded as a weapon of the first order,=20
while in our country it was the last resort of unemployed poli=C2=AC=20
ticians and a comfortable haven for slackers.=20

And, as was to be expected, its results all in all were zero.=20


CHAPTER=20

The Revolution=20


ith the year 1915 enemy propaganda=20
began in our country, after 1916 it became more and more in=C2=AC=20
tensive, till finally, at the beginning of the year 1918, it swelled=20
to a positive flood. Now the results of this seduction could be=20
seen at every step. The army gradually learned to think as the=20
enemy wanted it to.=20

And the German counter-action was a complete failure.=20

In the person of the man whose intellect and will made him its=20
leader, the army had the intention and determination to take=20
up the struggle in this field, too, but it lacked the instrument=20
which would have been necessary. And from the psychological=20
point of view, it was wrong to have this enlightenment work car=C2=AC=20
ried on by the troops themselves. If it was to be effective, it=20
had to come from home. Only then was there any assurance of=20
success among the men who, after all, had been performing im=20
mortal deeds of heroism and privation for nearly four years for=20
this homeland.=20

But what came out of the home country?=20

Was this failure stupidity or crime?=20

In midsummer of 1918, after the evacuation of the southern=20
bank of the Marne, the German press above all conducted itself=20
with such miserable awkwardness, nay, criminal stupidity, that=20
my wrath mounted by the day, and the question arose within=20
me: Is there really no one who can put an end to this spiritual=20
squandering of the army=E2=80=99s heroism?=20

What happened in France in 1914 when we swept into the=20
country in an unprecedented storm of victory? What did Italy=20
do in the days after her Isonzo front had collapsed? And what=20
again did France do in the spring of 1918 when the attack of the=20
German divisions seemed to lift her positions off their hinges and=20
the far-reaching arm of the heavy long-range batteries began=20
to knock at the doors of Paris?=20

How they whipped the fever heat of national passion into the=20
faces of the hastily retreating regiments in those countries!=20
What propaganda and ingenious demagogy were used to hammer=20
the faith in.final victory back into the hearts of the broken fronts!=20

Meanwhile, what happened in our country?=20

Nothing, or worse than nothing.=20

Rage and indignation often rose up in me when I looked at the=20
latest newspapers, and came face to face with the psychological=20
mass murder that was being committed.=20

More than once I was tormented by the thought that if Provi=C2=AC=20
dence had put me in the place of the incapable or criminal in=C2=AC=20
competents or scoundrels in our propaganda service, our battle=20
with Destiny would have taken a different turn.=20

In these months I felt for the first time the whole malice of=20
Destiny which kept me at the front in a position where every=20
nigger might accidentally shoot me to bits, while elsewhere I=20
would have been able to perform quite different services for the=20
fatherland!=20

For even then I was rash enough to believe that I would have=20
succeeded in this.=20

But I was a nameless soldier, one among eight million!=20

And so it was better to hold my tongue and do my duty in the=20
trenches as best I could.=20

In the summer of 1915, the first enemy leaflets fell into our=20
hands.=20


The First Enemy Leaflets=20


189=20


Aside from a few changes in the form of presentation, their=20
content was almost always the same, to wit: that the suffering=20
was growing greater and greater in Germany; that the War was=20
going to last forever while the hope of winning it was gradually=20
vanishing; that the people at home were, therefore, longing for=20
peace, but that =E2=80=98 militarism=E2=80=99 and the =E2=80=98Kaiser=E2=80=
=99 did not allow it;=20
that the whole world =E2=80=94 to whom this was very well known =E2=80=94=
=20
was, therefore, not waging a war on the German people, but ex=C2=AC=20
clusively against the sole guilty party, the Kaiser; that, therefore,=20
the War would not be over before this enemy of peaceful human=C2=AC=20
ity should be eliminated; that when the War was ended, the=20
libertarian and democratic nations would take the German=20
people into the league of eternal world peace, which would be=20
assured from the hour when *Prussian militarism=E2=80=99 was destroyed.=20

The,better to illustrate these claims, Tetters from home=E2=80=99 were=20
often reprinted whose contents seemed to confirm these asser=C2=AC=20
tions.=20

On the whole, we only laughed in those days at all these=20
efforts. The leaflets were read, then sent back to the higher=20
staffs, and for the most part forgotten until the wind again sent=20
a load of them sailing down into the trenches; for, as a rule, the=20
leaflets were brought over by airplanes.=20

In this type of propaganda there was one point which soon=20
inevitably attracted attention: in every sector of the front where=20
Bavarians were stationed, Prussia was attacked with extraordi=C2=AC=20
nary consistency, with the assurance that not only was Prussia=20
on the one hand the really guilty and responsible party for the=20
whole war, but that on the other hand there was not the slightest=20
hostility against Bavaria in particular; however, there was no=20
helping Bavaria as long as she served Prussian militarism and=20
helped to pull its chestnuts out of the fire.=20

Actually this kind of propaganda began to achieve certain=20
effects in 1915. The feeling against Prussia grew quite visibly=20
among the troops =E2=80=94 yet not a single step was taken against it=20
from above. This was more than a mere sin of omission, and=20
sooner or later we were bound to suffer most catastrophically=20


190=20


Mein Kampe=20


for it; and not just the Prussians/ but the whole German people,=20
to which Bavaria herself is not the last to belong.=20

In this direction enemy propaganda began to achieve un=C2=AC=20
questionable successes from 1916 on.=20

Likewise the complaining letters direct from home had long=20
been having their effect. It was no longer necessary for the=20
enemy to transmit them to the frontline soldiers by means of=20
leaflets, etc. And against this, aside from a few psychologically=20
idiotic =E2=80=98admonitions=E2=80=99 on the part of the =E2=80=98governmen=
t,=E2=80=99 nothing=20
was done. Just as before, the front was flooded with this poison=20
dished up ,by thoughtless women at home, who, of course, did=20
not suspect that this was the way to raise the enemy=E2=80=99s confidence=
=20
in victory to the highest pitch, thus consequently to prolong and=20
sharpen the sufferings of their men at the fighting'front. In=20
the time that followed, the senseless letters of German women=20
cost hundreds of thousands of men their lives.=20

Thus, as early as 1916, there appeared various phenomena that=20
would better have been absent. 1 The men at the front complained=20
and =E2=80=98beefed=E2=80=99; they began to be dissatisfied in many ways an=
d=20
sometimes were even righteously indignant. While they starved=20
and suffered, while their people at home lived in misery, there=20
was abundance and high-living in other circles. Yes, even at the=20
fighting front all was not in order in this respect.=20

Even then a slight crisis was emerging =E2=80=94 but these were still=20
=E2=80=98internal=E2=80=99 affairs. The same man, who at first had cursed a=
nd=20
grumbled, silently did his duty a few minutes later as though=20
this was a matter of course. The same company, which at first=20
was discontented, clung to the piece of trench it had to defend=20
as though Germany=E2=80=99s fate depended on these few hundred yards=20
of mudholes. It was still the front of the old, glorious army of=20
heroes!=20

I was to learn the difference between it and the homeland in a=20
glaring contrast.=20

At the end of September, 1916, my division moved into the=20

Battle of the Somme. For us it was the first of the tremendous=20
battles of materiel which now followed, and the impression was=20
hard to describe =E2=80=94 it was more like hell than war.=20

Under a whirlwind of drumfire that lasted for weeks, the=20
German front held fast, sometimes forced back a little, then again=20
pushing forward, but never wavering.=20

On October 7, 1916, I was wounded.=20

I was brought safely to the rear, and from there was to return=20
to Germany with a transport.=20

Two years had now passed since I had seen the homeland,=20
under such conditions an almost endless time. I could scarcely=20
imagine how Germans looked who were not in uniform. As I=20
lay in the field hospital at Hermies, I almost collapsed for fright=20
when suddenly the voice of a German woman serving as a nurse=20
addressed a man lying beside me.=20

For the first time in two years to hear such a sound!=20

The closer our train which was to bring us home approached=20
the border, the more inwardly restless each of us became. All=20
the towns passed by, through which we had ridden two years=20
previous as young soldiers: Brussels, Louvain, Liege, and at last=20
we thought we recognized the first German house by its high=20
gable and beautiful shutters.=20

The fatherland!=20

In October, 1914, we had burned with stormy enthusiasm as=20
we crossed the border; now silence and emotion reigned. Each=20
of us was happy that Fate again permitted him to see what he=20
had had to defend so hard with his life, and each man was well-=20
nigh ashamed to let another look him in the eye.=20

It was almost on the anniversary of the day when I left for=20
the front that I reached the hospital at Beelitz near Berlin.=20

What a change! From the mud of the Battle of the Somme=20
into the white beds of this miraculous building! In the beginning=20
we hardly dared to lie in them properly. Only gradually could=20
we reaccustom ourselves to this new world.=20

Unfortunately, this world was new in another respect as well.=20

The spirit of the army at the front seemed no longer to be a=20

Mein Kampf=20


guest here. 1 Here for the first time I heard a thing that was still=20
unknown at the front; men bragging about their own cowardice!=20
For the cursing and =E2=80=98beefing=E2=80=99 you could hear at the front w=
ere=20
never an incitement to shirk duty or a glorification of the coward.=20
No! The coward still passed as a coward and as nothing else;=20
and the contempt which struck him was still general, just like the=20
admiration that was given to the real hero. But here in the=20
hospital it was partly almost the opposite: the most unscrupu=C2=AC=20
lous agitators did the talking and attempted with all the means=20
of their contemptible eloquence to make the conceptions of the=20
decent soldiers ridiculous and hold up the spineless coward as an=20
example. A few wretched scoundrels in particular set the tone.=20
One boasted that he himself had pulled his hand through a=20
barbed-wire entanglement in order to be sent to the hospital;=20
in spite of this absurd wound he seemed to have been here for=20
an endless time, and for that matter he had only gotten into the=20
transport to Germany by a swindle. This poisonous fellow went=20
so far in his insolent effrontery as to represent his own cowardice=20
as an emanation 2 of higher bravery than the hero=E2=80=99s death of an=20
honest soldier. Many listened in silence, others went away, but=20
a few assented.=20

Disgust mounted to my throat, but the agitator was calmly=20
tolerated in the institution. What could be done? The manage=C2=AC=20
ment couldn=E2=80=99t help knowing, and actually did know, exactly=20
who and what he was. But nothing was done.=20

When I could again walk properly, I obtained permission to=20
go to Berlin.=20

Clearly there was dire misery everywhere. The big city was=20
suffering from hunger. Discontent was great. In various sol=C2=AC=20
diers=E2=80=99 homes the tone was like that in the hospital. It gave you=20
the impression that these scoundrels were intentionally frequent=C2=AC=20
ing such places in order to spread their views.=20

But much, much worse were conditions in Munich itself!=20

When I was discharged from the hospital as cured and trans=C2=AC=20
ferred to the replacement battalion, I thought I could no longer=20

=80=99=20


Slackers=20


193=20


recognize the city. Anger, discontent, cursing, wherever you=20
went! In the replacement battalion itself the mood was beneath=20
all criticism. Here a contributing factor was the immeasurably=20
clumsy way in which the field soldiers were treated by old train=C2=AC=20
ing officers who hadn=E2=80=99t spent a single hour in the field and for=20
this reason alone were only partially able to create a decent rela=C2=AC=20
tionship with the old soldiers. For it had to be admitted that=20
the latter possessed certain qualities which could be explained=20
by their service at the front, but which remained totally incom=C2=AC=20
prehensible to the leaders of these replacement detachments,=20
while the officer who had come from the front was at least able=20
to explain them. The latter, of course, was respected by the men=20
quite differently than the rear commander. But aside from this,=20
the general mood was miserable: to be a slacker passed almost=20
as a sign of higher wisdom, while loyal steadfastness was con=C2=AC=20
sidered a symptom of inner weakness and narrow-mindedness.=20
The offices were filled with Jews. Nearly every clerk was a Jew=20
and nearly every Jew was a clerk. I was amazed at this plethora=20
of warriors of the chosen people and could not help but com=C2=AC=20
pare them with their rare representatives at the front.=20

As regards economic life, things were even worse Here the=20
Jewish people had become really =E2=80=98 indispensable.=E2=80=99 The spide=
r was=20
slowly beginning to suck the blood out of the people=E2=80=99s pores.=20
Through the war corporations, they had found an instrument with=20
which, little by little, to finish off the national free economy.=20

The necessity of an unlimited centralization was emphasized.=20

Thus, in the year 1916-17 nearly the whole of production was=20
under the control of Jewish finance.=20

But against whom was the hatred of the people directed?=20

At this time I saw with horror a catastrophe approaching=20
which, unless averted in time, would inevitably lead to collapse.=20

While the Jew robbed the whole nation and pressed it beneath=20
his domination, an agitation was carried on against the 1 Prus=C2=AC=20
sians.=E2=80=99 At home, as at the front, nothing was done against this=20
poisonous propaganda. No one seemed to suspect that the col=C2=AC=20
lapse of Prussia would not by a long shot bring with it a resurgence=20


194=20


Mein Kampe=20


of Bavaria; no, that on the contrary any fall of the one would=20
inevitably carry the other along with it into the abyss.=20

I felt very badly about this behavior. In it I could only see=20
the craftiest trick of the Jew, calculated to distract the general=20
attention from himself and to others. While the Bavarian and=20
the Prussian fought, he stole the existence of both of them from=20
under their nose; while the Bavarians were cursing the Prussians,=20
the Jew organized the revolution and smashed Prussia and=20
Bavaria at once.=20

I could not bear this accursed quarrel among German peoples,=20
and was glad to return to the front, for which I reported at once=20
after my arrival in Munich.=20

At the beginning of March, 1917,1 was back with my regiment.=20

Toward the end of 1917, the low point of the army=E2=80=99s dejection=20
seemed to have passed. The whole army took fresh hope and=20
fresh courage after the Russian collapse. The conviction that=20
the War would end with the victory of Germany, after all, began=20
to seize the troops more and more. Again singing could be heard=20
and the Calamity Janes became rarer. Again people believed in=20
the future of the fatherland.=20

Especially the Italian collapse of autumn, 1917, had had the=20
most wonderful effect; in this victory we saw a proof of the possi=C2=AC=20
bility of breaking through the front, even aside from the Russian=20
theater of war. A glorious faith flowed again into the hearts of=20
the millions, enabling them to await spring, 1918, with relief and=20
confidence. The foe was visibly depressed. In this winter he=20
remained quieter than usual. This was the lull before the storm.=20

But, while those at the front were undertaking the last prepa=C2=AC=20
rations for the final conclusion of the eternal struggle, while end=C2=AC=
=20
less transports of men and materiel were rolling toward the West=20
Front, and the troops were being trained for the great attack =E2=80=94=20
the biggest piece of chicanery in the whole war broke out in=20
Germany.=20


The Army=E2=80=99s New Hope=20


195=20


Germany must not be victorious; in the last hour, with victory=20
already threatening to be with the German banners, a means=20
was chosen which seemed suited to stifle the German spring=20
attack in the germ with one blow, to make victory impossible:=20

The munitions strike was organized.=20

If it succeeded, the German front was bound to collapse, and=20
the Vorwarts =E2=80=99 1 desire that this time victory should not be with=
=20
the German banners would inevitably be fulfilled. Owing to the=20
lack of munitions, the front would inevitably be pierced in a=20
few weeks; thus the offensive was thwarted, the Entente saved,=20
international capital was made master of Germany, and the=20
inner aim of the Marxist swindle of nations achieved.=20

To smash the national economy and establish the rule of inter=C2=AC=20
national capital =E2=80=94 a goal which actually was achieved, thanks=20
to the stupidity and credulity of the one side and the bottomless=20
cowardice of the other.=20

To be sure, the munitions strike did not have all the hoped-for=20
success with regard to starving the front of arms; it collapsed too=20
soon for the lack of munitions as such =E2=80=94 as the plan had been =E2=
=80=94=20
to doom the army to destruction.=20

But how much more terrible was the moral damage that had=20
been done!=20

In the first place: What was the army fighting for if the home=C2=AC=20
land itself no longer wanted victory? For whom the immense=20
sacrifices and privations? The soldier is expected to fight for=20
victory and the homeland goes on strike against it!=20

And in the second place: What was the effect on the enemy?=20

In the winter of 1917 to 1918, dark clouds appeared for the=20
first time in the firmament of the Allied world. For nearly four=20
years they had been assailing the German warrior and had been=20
unable to encompass his downfall; and all this while the German=20
had only his shield arm free for defense, while his sword was=20

founded in 1884 as the Berliner Volksblatt. It was renamed Vorwarts in 1890=

tinued to appear until 1933.=20


196=20


Mein Kampf=20


obliged to strike, now in the East, now in the South. But now=20
at last the giant=E2=80=99s back was free. Streams of blood had flown=20
before he administered final defeat to one of his foes. Now in the=20
West his shield was going to be joined by his sword; up till then=20
the enemy had been unable to break his defense, and now he=20
himself was facing attack.=20

The enemy feared him and trembled for their victory.=20

In London and Paris one deliberation followed another, but=20
at the front sleepy silence prevailed. Suddenly their high mighti=C2=AC=20
nesses lost their effrontery. Even enemy propaganda was having=20
a hard time of it; it was no longer so easy to prove the hopeless=C2=AC=20
ness of German victory.=20

But this also applied to the Allied troops at the fronts. A=20
ghastly light began to dawn slowly even on them. Their inner=20
attitude toward the German soldier had changed. Until then=20
he may have seemed to them a fool destined to defeat; but now=20
it was the destroyer of the Russian ally that stood before them.=20
The limitation of the German offensives to the East, though=20
born of necessity, now seemed to them brilliant tactics. For=20
three years these Germans had stormed the Russian front, at=20
first it seemed without the slightest success. The Allies almost=20
laughed over this aimless undertaking; for in the end the Russian=20
giant with his overwhelming number of men was sure to remain=20
the victor while Germany would inevitably collapse from loss of=20
blood. Reality seemed to confirm this hope.=20

Since the September days of 1914, when for the first time the=20
endless hordes of Russian prisoners from the Battle of Tannem=20
berg began moving into Germany over the roads and railways,=20
this stream was almost without end =E2=80=94 but for every defeated=20
and destroyed army a new one arose. Inexhaustibly the gigantic=20
Empire gave the Tsar more and more new soldiers and the War=20
its new victims. How long could Germany keep up this race?=20
Would not the day inevitably come when the Germans would win=20
their last victory and still the Russian armies would not be march=C2=AC=20
ing to their last battle? And then what? In all human proba=C2=AC=20
bility the victory of Russia could be postponed, but it was bound=20
to come-.=20


=E2=80=98Germany Facing Revolution!=E2=80=99=20


197=20


Now all these hopes were at an end: the ally who had laid the=20
greatest blood sacrifices on the altar of common interests was at=20
the end of his strength, and lay prone at the feet of the inexor=C2=AC=20
able assailant. Fear and horror crept into the hearts of the=20
soldiers who had hitherto believed so blindly. They feared the=20
coming spring. For if up until then they had not succeeded in=20
defeating the German when he was able to place only part of=20
his forces on the Western Front, how could they count on vic=C2=AC=20
tory now that the entire power of this incredible heroic state=20
seemed to be concentrating for an attack on the West?=20

The shadows of the South Tyrolean Mountains lay oppressive=20
on the fantasy; as far as the mists of Flanders, the defeated=20
armies of Cadorna conjured up gloomy faces, and faith in victory=20
ceded to fear of coming defeat.=20

Then =E2=80=94 when out of the cool nights the Allied soldiers already=20
seemed to hear the dull rumble of the advancing storm units=20
of the German army, and with eyes fixed in fear and trepidation=20
awaited the approaching judgment, suddenly a flaming red light=20
arose in Germany, casting its glow into the last shell-hole of the=20
enemy front: at the very moment when the German divisions=20
were receiving their last instructions for the great attack, the=20
general strike broke out in Germany.=20

At first the world was speechless. But then enemy propaganda=20
hurled itself with a sigh of relief on this help that came in the=20
eleventh hour. At one stroke the means was found to restore the=20
sinking confidence of the Allied soldiers, once again to represent=20
the probability of victory as certain, 1 and transform dread anxiety=20
in the face of coming events into determined confidence. Now=20
the regiments awaiting the German attack could be sent into=20
the greatest battle of all time with the conviction that, not the=20
boldness of the German assault would decide the end of this war,=20
but the perseverance of the defense. Let the Germans achieve=20
as many victories as they pleased; at home the revolution was=20
before the door, and not the victorious army.=20

English, French, and American newspapers began to implant=20

1 c die Wahrscheinlichkeit als sicker hinzuslellen .. /=20


198=20


Mein Kampf=20


this faith in the hearts of their readers while an infinitely shrewd=20
propaganda raised the spirits of the troops at the front.=20

=E2=80=98Germany facing revolution! Victory of the Allies inevitable!=E2=80=
=99=20
This was the best medicine to help the wavering poilu and Tommy=20
back on'their feet. Now rifles and machine guns could again be=20
made to fire, and a headlong flight in panic fear was replaced by=20
hopeful resistance.=20

This was the result of the munitions strike. It strengthened=20
the enemy peoples=E2=80=99 belief in victory and relieved the paralyzing=20
despair of the Allied front =E2=80=94 in the time that followed, thousands=
=20
of German soldiers had to pay for this with their blood. The=20
instigators of this vilest of all scoundrelly tricks were the as=C2=AC=20
pirants to the highest state positions of revolutionary Germany.=20

On the German side, it is true, the visible reaction to this=20
crime could at first apparently be handled; on the enemy side,=20
however, the consequences did not fail to appear. The resistance=20
had lost the aimlessness of an army giving up all as lost, and took=20
on the bitterness of a struggle for victory.=20

For now, in all human probability, victory was inevitable if=20
the Western Front could stand up under a German attack for=20
only a few months. The parliaments of the Entente, however,=20
recognized the possibilities for the future and approved unprece=C2=AC=20
dented expenditures for continuing the propaganda to disrupt=20
Germany.=20


X TP=20

I had the good fortune to fight in the first two offensives and=20
in the last.=20

These became the most tremendous impressions of my life;=20
tremendous because now for the last time, as in 1914, the fight=20
lost the character of defense and assumed that of attack. A=20
sigh of relief passed through the trenches and the dugouts of=20
the German army when at length, after more than three years=E2=80=99=20
endurance in the enemy hell, the day of retribution came. Once=20


Last Wreaths of Immortal Laurel=20


199=20


again the victorious battalions cheered and hung the last wreaths=20
of immortal laurel on their banners rent by the storm of victory.=20
Once again the songs of the fatherland roared to the heavens=20
along the endless marching columns, and for the last time the=20
Lord=E2=80=99s grace smiled on His ungrateful children.=20

In midsummer of 1918, oppressive sultriness lay over the front.=20
At home there was fighting. For what? In the different detach=C2=AC=20
ments of the field army all sorts of things were being said: that=20
the war was now hopeless and only fools could believe in victory.=20
That not the people but only capital and the monarchy had an=20
interest in holding out any longer =E2=80=94 all this came from the=20
homeland and was discussed even at the front.=20

At first the front reacted very little. What did we care about=20
universal suffrage? Had we fought four years for that? It was=20
vile banditry to steal the war aim of the dead heroes from their=20
very graves. The young regiments had not gone to their death=20
in Flanders crying: =E2=80=98Long live universal suffrage and the secret=20
ballot,=E2=80=99 but crying: 1 Deutschland Uher Alles in der Welt.=E2=80=99=
 A small,=20
yet not entirely insignificant, difference. But most of those who=20
cried out for suffrage hadn=E2=80=99t ever been in the place where they=20
now wanted to fight for it. The front was unknown to the whole=20
political party rabble. Only a small fraction of the Parliamentar=C2=AC=20
ian gentlemen could be seen where all decent Germans with=20
sound limbs left were sojourning at that time.=20

And so the old personnel at the front was not very receptive to=20
this new war aim of Messrs. Ebert, Scheidemann, 1 Barth, Lieb-=20

1 Friedrich Ebert and Philip Scheidemann were leaders of the majority=20
Socialists who took over the German government on the abdication of=20
William II on November 9, 1918. On November 25, representatives of the=20
new provincial governments met in Berlin and decided on the election of a=
=20
National Assembly. Elections took place on January 19. The Assembly,=20
which met in Weimar on February 6, was controlled by a coalition of the=20


200=20


Mein Kampf=20


nitz, etc. They couldn=E2=80=99t for the life of them see why suddenly the=
=20
slackers should have the right to arrogate to themselves control=20
of the state over the heads of the army.=20

My personal attitude was established from the very start. I=20
hated the whole gang of miserable party scoundrels and betrayers=20
of the people in the extreme. It had long been clear to me that=20
this whole gang was not really concerned with the welfare of the=20
nation, but with filling empty pockets. For this they were ready=20
to sacrifice the whole nation, and if necessary to let Germany be=20
destroyed; and in my eyes this made them ripe for hanging. To=20
take consideration of their wishes was to sacrifice the interests=20
of the working people for the benefit of a few pickpockets; these=20
wishes could only be fulfilled by giving up Germany.=20

And the great majority of the embattled army still thought=20
the same. Only the reinforcements coming from home rapidly=20
grew worse and worse, so that their arrival meant, not a rein=C2=AC=20
forcement but a weakening of our fighting strength. Especially=20
the young reinforcements were mostly worthless. It was often=20
hard to believe that these were sons of the same nation which=20
had once sent its youth out to the battle for Ypres.=20

In August and September, the symptoms of disorganization=20
increased more and more rapidly, although the effect of the=20
enemy attack was not to be compared with the terror of our=20
former defensive battles. The past Battle of Flanders and. the=20
Battle of the Somme had been awesome by comparison.=20

At the end of September, my division arrived for the third=20
time at the positions which as young volunteer regiments we had=20
once stormed.=20

What a memory!=20

Socialists, the Center, and the Democrats, led by Scheidemann. On Feb=C2=AC=
=20
ruary 11, it chose Friedrich Ebert President of Germany. The Scheidemann=20
Cabinet resigned on June 20 because it was unwilling to sign the peace=20
treaty. The treaty was signed by the succeeding Cabinet of Gustav Bauer=20
after the Assembly had voted acceptance. The Socialist and Democrat=20
majority were attacked by both Right and Left for accepting this =E2=80=98n=

In October and November of 1914, we had there received our=20
baptism of fire. Fatherland love in our heart and songs on our=20
lips, our young regiments had gone into the battle as to a dance.=20
The most precious blood there sacrificed itself joyfully, in the=20
faith that it was preserving the independence and freedom of=20
the fatherland.=20

In July, 1917, we set foot for the second time on the ground=20
that was sacred to all of us. For in it the best comrades slumbered,=20
still almost children, who had run to their death with gleaming=20
eyes for the one true fatherland.=20

We old soldiers, who had then marched out with the regiment,=20
stood in respectful emotion at this shrine of =E2=80=98loyalty and obedi=C2=
=AC=20
ence to the death.=E2=80=99=20

Now in a hard defensive battle the regiment was to defend=20
this soil which it had stormed three years earlier.=20

With three weeks of drumfire the Englishman prepared the=20
great Flanders offensive. The spirits of the dead seemed to=20
quicken; the regiment clawed its way into the filthy mud, bit=20
into the various holes and craters, and neither gave ground nor=20
wavered. As once before in this place, it grew steadily smaller=20
and thinner, until the British attack finally broke loose on July=20
13, 1917.=20

In the first days of August we were relieved.=20

The regiment had turned into a few companies: crusted with=20
mud they tottered back, more like ghosts than men. But aside=20
from a few hundred meters of shell holes, the Englishman had=20
found nothing but death.=20

Now, in the fall of 1918, we stood for the third time on the=20
storm site of 1914. The little city of Comines where we then=20
rested had now become our battlefield. Yet, though the battle=C2=AC=20
field was the same, the men had changed: for now =E2=80=98political dis=C2=
=AC=20
cussions=E2=80=99 went on even among the troops. As everywhere, the=20
poison of the hinterland began, here too, to be effective. And=20
the younger recruit fell down completely =E2=80=94 for he came from=20
home.=20

In the night of October 13, the English gas attack on the=20


202=20


Mein Kampf=20


southern front before Ypres burst loose; they used yellow-cross=20
gas, whose effects were still unknown to, us as far as personal ex=C2=AC=20
perience was concerned. In this same night I myself was to=20
become acquainted with it. On a hill south of Wervick, we came=20
on the evening of October 13 into several hours of drumfire with=20
gas shells which continued all night more or less violently. As=20
early as midnight, a number of us passed out, a few of our com=C2=AC=20
rades forever. Toward morning I, too, was seized with pain=20
which grew worse with every quarter hour, and at seven in the=20
morning I stumbled and tottered back with burning eyes;=20
taking with me my last report of the War.=20

A few hours later, my eyes had turned into glowing coals;=20
it had grown dark around me.=20

Thus I came to the hospital at Pasewalk in Pomerania, and=20
there I was fated to experience =E2=80=94 the greatest villainy of the=20
century. 1=20


# # #=20

For a long time there had been something indefinite but re=C2=AC=20
pulsive in the air. People were telling each other that in the=20
next few weeks it would =E2=80=98 start in =E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 but I was un=
able to imagine=20
what was meant by this. First I thought of a strike like that of=20
the spring. Unfavorable rumors were constantly coming from=20
the navy, which was said to be in a state of ferment. But this,=20
too, seemed to me more the product of the imagination of indi=C2=AC=20
vidual scoundrels than an affair involving real masses. Even in=20
the hospital, people were discussing the end of the War which=20
they hoped would come soon, but no one counted on anything=20
immediate. I was unable to read the papers.=20

In November the general tension increased.=20

And then one day, suddenly and unexpectedly, the calamity=20
descended. Sailors arrived in trucks and proclaimed the revolu-=20

tion; a few Jewish youths were the =E2=80=98 leaders =E2=80=99 in this stru=
ggle for=20
the =E2=80=98freedom, beauty, and dignity=E2=80=99 of our national existenc=
e.=20
None of them had been at the front. By way of a so-called=20
=E2=80=98gonorrhoea hospital,=E2=80=99 the three Orientals had been sent ba=
ck=20
home from their second-line base. Now they raised the red rag=20
in the homeland.=20

In the last few days I had been getting along better. The=20
piercing pain in my eye sockets was diminishing; slowly I suc=C2=AC=20
ceeded in distinguishing the broad outlines of the things about=20
me. I was given grounds for hoping that I should recover my=20
eyesight at least well enough to be able to pursue some profession=20
later. To be sure, I could no longer hope that I would ever be=20
able to draw again. In any case, I was on the road to improve=C2=AC=20
ment when the monstrous thing happened.=20

My first hope was still that this high treason might still be a=20
more or less local affair. I also tried to bolster up a few comrades=20
in this view. Particularly my Bavarian friends in the hospital=20
were more than accessible to this. The mood there was anything=20
but =E2=80=98revolutionary.=E2=80=99 I could not imagine that the madness w=
ould=20
break out in Munich, too. Loyalty to the venerable House of=20
Wittelsbach 1 seemed to me stronger, after all, than the will of a=20
few Jews. Thus I could not help but believe that this was merely=20
a Putsch on the part of the navy and would be crushed in the=20
next few days.=20

The next few days came and with them the most terrible cer=C2=AC=20
tainty of my life. The rumors became more and more oppressive.=20
What I had taken for a local affair was now said to be a general=20
revolution. To this was added the disgraceful news from the=20
front. They wanted to capitulate. Was such a thing really=20
possible?=20

On November 10, the pastor came to the hospital for a short=20
address: now we learned everything.=20

In extreme agitation, I, too, was present at the short speech.=20
The dignified old gentleman seemed all a-tremble as he informed=20

'republic=E2=80=99; that we must pray to the Almighty not to refuse His=20
blessing to this change and not to abandon our people in the=20
times to come. He could not help himself, he had to speak a few=20
words in memory of the royal house. He began to praise its=20
services in Pomerania, in Prussia, nay, to the German fatherland,=20
and =E2=80=94 here he began to sob gently to himself =E2=80=94 in the littl=
e hall=20
the deepest dejection settled on all hearts, and I believe that not=20
an eye was able to restrain its tears. But when the old gentle=C2=AC=20
man tried to go on, and began to tell us that we must now end=20
the long War, yes, that now that it was lost and we were throw=C2=AC=20
ing ourselves upon the mercy of the victors, our fatherland would=20
for the future be exposed to dire oppression, that the armistice=20
should be accepted with confidence in the magnanimity of our=20
previous enemies =E2=80=94 I could stand it no longer. It became im=C2=AC=
=20
possible for me to sit still one minute more. Again everything=20
went black before my eyes; I tottered and groped my way back=20
to the dormitory, threw myself on my bunk, and dug my burn=C2=AC=20
ing head into my blanket and pillow.=20

Since the day when I had stood at my mother=E2=80=99s grave, I had=20
not wept. When in my youth Fate seized me with merciless=20
hardness, my defiance mounted. When in the long war years=20
Death snatched so many a dear comrade and friend from our=20
ranks, it would have seemed to me almost a sin to complain =E2=80=94=20
after all, were they not dying for Germany? And when at length=20
the creeping gas =E2=80=94 in the last days of the dreadful struggle =E2=80=
=94=20
attacked me, too, and began to gnaw at my eyes, and beneath=20
the fear of going blind forever, I nearly lost heart for a moment,=20
the voice of my conscience thundered at me: Miserable wretch,=20
are you going to cry when thousands are a hundred times worse=20
off than you! And so I bore my lot in dull silence. But now I=20
could not help it. Only now did I see how all personal suffer=C2=AC=20
ing vanishes in comparison with the misfortune of the father-=20
land.=20

And so it had all been in vain. In vain all the sacrifices and=20

privations; in vain the hunger and thirst of months which were=20
often endless; in vain the hours in which, with mortal fear clutch=C2=AC=20

death of two millions who died. Would not the graves of all the=20
hundreds of thousands open, the graves of those who with Jfyith=20
in the fatherland had marched forth never to return? Would=20
&lt;!hey not open and send the silent mud- and blood-covered heroes=20
back as spirits of vengeance to the homeland which had cheated=20
them with such mockery of the highest sacrifice which a mao=20
can make to his people in this world? Had they died for this, the=20
soldiers of August and September, 1914? Was it for this that=20
in the autumn of the same year the volunteer regiments marched=20
after their old comrades? Was it for this that these boys of=20
seventeen sank into the earth of Flanders? Was this the mean=C2=AC=20

gang of wretched criminals could lay hands on the fatherland?=20

Was it for this that the German soldier had stood fast in the=20
sun=E2=80=99s heat and in snowstorms, hungry, thirsty, and freezing,=20
weary from sleepless nights and endless marches? Was it for=20
this that he had lain in the hell of the drumfire and in the fever=20
of gas attacks without wavering, always thoughtful of his one=20
duty to preserve the fatherland from the enemy peril?=20

Verily these heroes deserved a headstone: =E2=80=98Thou Wanderer who=20
comest to Germany, tell those at home that we lie here, true to=20
the fatherland and obedient to duty.=E2=80=99=20

And what about those at home =E2=80=94 ?=20

And yet, was it only our own sacrifice that we had to weigh in=20
the balance? Was the Germany of the past less precious? Was=20
there no obligation toward our own history? Were we still=20
worthy to relate the glory of the past to ourselves? And how=20
could this deed be justified to future generations?=20

my brow. What was all the pain in my eyes compared to this=20
misery?=20

There followed terrible days and even worse nights =E2=80=94 I knew=20
that all was lost. Only fools, liars, and criminals could hope in=20
the mercy of the enemy. In these nights hatred grew in me,=20
hatred for those responsible for this deed.=20

In the days that followed, my own fate became known to me.=20

I could not help but laugh at the thought of my own future=20
which only a short time before had given me such bitter con=C2=AC=20

ground? At last it became clear to me that what had happened=20
was what I had so often feared but had never been able to=20
believe with my emotions.=20

CHAPTER=20

VIII=20


The Beginning of My Political Activity=20


A=20

2. JLt the end of November, 1918,1 returned=20
to Munich. Again I went to the replacement battalion of my=20
regiment, which was in the hands of =E2=80=98soldiers' councils.' Their=20
whole activity was so repellent to me that I decided at once to=20
leave again as soon as possible. With Schmiedt Ernst, a faithful=20
war comrade, I went to Traunstein and remained there till the=20
camp was broken up.=20

In March, 1919, we went back to Munich.=20

The situation was untenable and moved inevitably toward a fur=C2=AC=20
ther continuation of the revolution. Eisner's death only hastened=20
the development and finally led to a dictatorship of the Councils, 1=20
or, better expressed, to a passing rule of the Jews, as had been=20
the original aim of the instigators of the whole revolution.=20

At this time endless plans chased one another through my head.=20
For days I wondered what could be done, but the end of every=20
meditation was the sober realization that I, nameless as I was,=20
did not possess the least basis for any useful action. I shall come=20
back to speak of the reasons why then, as before, I could not de=C2=AC=20
cide to join any of the existing parties.=20

In the course of the new revolution of the Councils I for the=20

1 Kurt Eisner (1867-1919). Edited the Vorwarts from 1899 to 1905. In 1917=
=20
he went over from the Majority to the Independent Socialists. On Novembet=
=20
7, 1918, he led the revolution in Munich and headed a government of Ma=C2=
=AC=20
jority and Independent Socialists. He was assassinated on February 21.1919=
=20


=E2=9C=93=20


208=20


Mein Kampf=20


first time acted in such a way as to arouse the disapproval of the=20
Central Council. Early in the morning of April 27, 1919, I was=20
to be arrested, but, faced with my leveled carbine, the three=20
scoundrels lacked the necessary courage and marched off as they=20
had come.=20

A few days after the liberation of Munich, I was ordered to re=C2=AC=20
port to the examining commission concerned with revolutionary=20
occurrences in the Second Infantry Regiment.=20

This was my first more or less purely political activity.=20

Only a few weeks afterward I received orders to attend a=20
1 course =E2=80=99 that was held for members of the armed forces. In it the=
=20
soldier was supposed to learn certain fundamentals of civic think=C2=AC=20
ing. For me the value of the whole affair was that I now obtained=20
an opportunity of meeting a few like-minded comrades with=20
whom I could thoroughly discuss the situation of the moment.=20
All of us were more or less firmly convinced that Germany could=20
no longer be saved from the impending collapse by the parties of=20
the November crime, the Center and the Social Democracy, and=20

that the so-called =E2=80=98 bourgeois-national =E2=80=99 formations, even =
with the=20

*=20

best of intentions, could never repair what had happened. A whole=20
series of preconditions were lacking, without which such a task=20
simply could not succeed. The following period confirmed the=20
opinion we then held. Thus, in our own circle we discussed the=20
foundation of a new party. The basic ideas which we had in mind=20
were the same as those later realized in the * German Workers=E2=80=99=20
Party.=E2=80=99 The name of the movement to be founded would from=20
the very beginning have to offer the possibility of approaching=20
the broad masses; for without this quality the whole task seemed=20
aimless and superfluous. Thus we arrived at the name of =E2=80=98 Social=20
Revolutionary Party=E2=80=99; this because the social views of the new=20
organization did indeed mean a revolution.=20

But the deeper ground for this lay in the following: however=20
much I had concerned myself with economic questions at an=20
earlier day, my efforts had remained more or less within the=20
limits resulting from the contemplation of social questions as=20
such. Only later did this framework broaden through examina*=20


The Two Types of Capital=20


209=20


tion of the German alliance policy. This in very great part was=20
the outcome of a false estimation of economics as well as un=C2=AC=20
clarity concerning the possible basis for sustaining the German=20
people in the future. But all these ideas were based on the opinion=20
that capital in any case was solely the result of labor and, there=C2=AC=20
fore, like itself was subject to the correction of all those factors=20
which can either advance or thwart human activity; and the=20
national importance of capital was that it depended so com=C2=AC=20
pletely on the greatness, freedom, and power of the state, hence=20
of the nation, that this bond in itself would inevitably cause=20
capital to further the state and the nation owing to its simple in=C2=AC=20
stinct of self-preservation or of reproduction. This dependence=20
of capital on the independent free state would, therefore, force=20
capital in turn to champion this freedom, power, strength, etc.,=20
of the nation.=20

Thus, the task of the state toward capital was comparatively=20
simple and clear: it only had to make certain that capital remain=20
the handmaiden of the state and not fancy itself the mistress of=20
the nation. This point of view could then be defined between=20
two restrictive limits: preservation of a solvent, national, and=20
independent economy on the one hand, assurance of the social=20
rights of the workers on the other.=20

Previously I had been unable to recognize with the desired=20
clarity the difference between this pure capital as the end result=20
of productive labor and a capital whose existence and essence=20
rests exclusively on speculation. For this I lacked the initial in=C2=AC=20
spiration, which had simply not come my way.=20

But now this was provided most amply by one of the various=20
gentlemen lecturing in the above-mentioned course: Gottfried=20
Feder. 1=20

1 Gottfried Feder: bom in Wurzburg in 1883. An engineer by profession.=20
In 1917, he founded the Deutscher Kampfbund zur Brechung der Zinsknecht-=20
schaft (German Fighting League for the breaking of interest slavery).=20
Became a National Socialist member of the Reichstag in 1924. Later, he=20
became head of Hauptabteilung 1 ( Wirtschaftsabteuung ) der Reichsleitung d=
er=20
NSDAP , an economic body with elaborate plans for socialization. This was=
=20


210=20


Mein Kampf=20


For the first time in my life I heard a principled discussion of=20
international stock exchange and loan capital.=20

Right after listening to Feder=E2=80=99s first lecture, the thought ran=20
through my head that I had now found the way to one of the=20
most essential premises for the foundation of a new party.=20


X W TP=20


In my eyes Feder=E2=80=99s merit consisted in having established with=20
ruthless brutality the speculative and economic character of=20
stock exchange and loan capital, and in having exposed its eternal=20
and age-old presupposition which is interest. His arguments were=20
so sound in all fundamental questions that their critics from the=20
start questioned the theoretical correctness of the idea less than=20
they doubted the practical possibility of its execution. But what=20
in the eyes of others was a weakness of Feder=E2=80=99s arguments, in my=20
eyes constituted their strength.=20


* TT TP=20


It is not the task of a theoretician to determine the varying=20
degrees in which a cause can be realized, but to establish the=20
cause as such: that is to say: he must concern himself less with the=20
road than with the goal. In this, however, the basic correctness=20
of an idea is decisive and not the difficulty of its execution. As=20
soon as the theoretician attempts to take account of so-called=20
=E2=80=98utility=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98reality=E2=80=99 instead of the abso=
lute truth, his work will=20
cease to be a polar star of seeking humanity and instead will be=C2=AC=20
come a prescription for everyday life. The theoretician of a move=C2=AC=20
ment must lay down its goal, the politician strive for its fulfill-=20

dissolved by Hitler in 1932 to please the industrialists. From 1933 to 1934=
=20
Feder was Under-Secretary of State for Labor. Then he became professor=20
of economics at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg and virtually=
=20
disappeared from public life.=20


Theorist and Politician=20


211=20


ment. The thinking of the one, therefore, will be determined by=20
eternal truth, the actions of the other more by the practical=20
reality of the moment. The greatness of the one lies in the ab=C2=AC=20
solute abstract soundness of his idea, that of the other in his cor=C2=AC=
=20
rect attitude toward the given facts and their advantageous ap=C2=AC=20
plication; and in this the theoretician=E2=80=99s aim must serve as his=20
guiding star. While the touchstone for the stature of a politician=20
may be regarded as the success of his plans and acts =E2=80=94 in other=20
words, the degree to which they become reality =E2=80=94 the realization=20
of the theoretician=E2=80=99s ultimate purpose can never be realized, since=
,=20
though human thought can apprehend truths and set up crystal-=20
clear aims, complete fulfillment will fail due to the general im=C2=AC=20
perfection and inadequacy of man. The more abstractly correct=20
and hence powerful the idea will be, the more impossible remains=20
its complete fulfillment as long as it continues to depend on hu=C2=AC=20
man beings. Therefore, the stature of the theoretician must not=20
be measured by the fulfillment of his aims, but by their soundness=20
and the influence they have had on the development of humanity.=20
If this were not so, the founders of religion could not be counted=20
among the greatest men of this earth, since the fulfillment of=20
their ethical purposes will never be even approximately complete.=20
In its workings, even the religion of love is only the weak reflection=20
of the will of its exalted founder; its significance, however, lies in=20
the direction which it attempted to give to a universal human=20
development of culture, ethics, and morality.=20

The enormous difference between the tasks of the theoretician=20
and the politician is also the reason why a union of both in one=20
person is almost never found. This is especially true of the so-=20
called =E2=80=98successful=E2=80=99 politician of small format, whose activ=
ity for=20
the most part is only an =E2=80=98art of the possible,=E2=80=99 as Bismarck=
 rather=20
modestly characterized politics in general. The freer such a=20
=E2=80=98politician=E2=80=99 keeps himself from great ideas, the easier and=
 often=20
the more visible, but always the more rapid, his successes will be.=20
To be sure, they are dedicated to earthly transitoriness and=20
sometimes do not survive the death of their fathers. The work of=20
such politicians, by and large, is unimportant ror posterity, since=20


212=20


Mein Kampf=20


their successes in the present are based solely on keeping at a=20
distance all really great and profound problems and ideas, which=20
as such would only have been of value for later generations.=20

The execution of such aims, which have value and significance=20
for the most distant times, usually brings little reward to the man=20
who champions them and rarely finds understanding among the=20
great masses, who for the moment have more understanding for=20
beer and milk regulations than for farsighted plans for the future,=20
whose realization can only occur far hence, and whose benefits=20
will be reaped only by posterity.=20

Thus, from a certain vanity, which is always a cousin of stupid=C2=AC=20
ity, the great mass of politicians will keep far removed from all=20
really weighty plans for the future, in order not to lose the mo=C2=AC=20
mentary sympathy of the great mob. The success and significance=20
of such a politician lie then exclusively in the present, and do not=20
exist for posterity. But small minds are little troubled by this;=20
they are content.=20

With the theoretician conditions are different. His importance=20
lies almost always solely in the future, for not seldom he is what=20
is described by the world as =E2=80=98unworldly.=E2=80=99 For if the art of=
 the=20
politician is really the art of the possible, the theoretician is one=20
of those of whom it can be said that they are pleasing to the gods=20
only if they demand and want the impossible. He will almost=20
always have to renounce the recognition of the present, but in=20
return, provided his ideas are immortal, will harvest the fame of=20
posterity.=20

In long periods of humanity, it may happen once that the poli=C2=AC=20
tician is wedded to the theoretician. The more profound this=20
fusion, however, the greater are the obstacles opposing the work=20
of the politician. He no longer works for necessities which will be=20
understood by the first best shopkeeper, but for aims which only=20
the fewest comprehend. Therefore, his life is torn by love and=20
hate. The protest of the present which does not understand the=20
man, struggles with the recognition of posterity =E2=80=94 for which he=20
works.=20

For the greater a man=E2=80=99s works for the future, the less the pre-=20


"'i=20

sent can comprehend them; the harder his fight, and the rarer=20
success. If, however, once in centuries success does come to a=20
man, perhaps in his latter days a faint beam of his coming glory=20
may shine upon him. To be sure, these great men are only the=20
Marathon runners of history; the laurel wreath of the present=20
touches only the brow of the dying hero.=20

Among them must be counted the great warriors in this world=20
who, though not understood by the present, are nevertheless=20
prepared to carry the fight for their ideas and ideals to their end.=20
They are the men who some day will be closest to the heart of the=20
people; it almost seems as though every individual feels the duty=20
of compensating in the past for the sins which the present once=20
committed against the great. 1 Their life and work are followed=20
with admiring gratitude and emotion, and especially in days of=20
gloom they have the power to raise up broken hearts and despair=C2=AC=20
ing souls.=20

To them belong, not only the truly great statesmen, but all=20
other great reformers as well. Beside Frederick the Great stands=20
Martin Luther as well as Richard Wagner.=20

As I listened to Gottfried Feder=E2=80=99s first lecture about the * break=
=C2=AC=20
ing of interest slavery/ I knew at once that this was a theoretical=20
truth which would inevitably be of immense importance for the=20
future of the German people. The sharp separation of stock ex=C2=AC=20
change capital from the national economy offered the possibility=20
of opposing the internationalization of the German economy=20
without at the same time menacing the foundations of an inde=C2=AC=20
pendent national self-maintenance by a struggle against all=20
capital. The development of Germany was much too clear in my=20
eyes for me not to know that the hardest battle would have to be=20
fought, not against hostile nations, but against international=20
capital. In Feder=E2=80=99s lecture I sensed a powerful slogan for this=20
coming struggle.=20

And here again later developments proved how correct our=20
sentiment of those days was. Today the know-it-alls among our=20

1 =E2=80=98Nun in der Vergangenheit gut zu machen was die Gegenwart einst a=
n den=20
Grossen gesiindigt hatted=20


214=20


Mein Kampf=20


bourgeois politicians no longer laugh at us: today even they, in so=20
far as they are not conscious liars, see that international stock=20
exchange capital was not only the greatest agitator for the War,=20
but that especially, now that the fight is over, it spares no effort=20
to turn the peace into a hell.=20

The fight against international finance and loan capital=20
became the most important point in the program of the=20
German nation=E2=80=99s struggle for its economic independence and=20
freedom.=20

As regards the objections of so-called practical men, they can=20
be answered as follows: All fears regarding the terrible economic=20
consequences of the =E2=80=98breaking of interest slavery=E2=80=99 are supe=
rfluous;=20
for, in the first place, the previous economic prescriptions have=20
turned out very badly for the German people, and your positions=20
on the problems of national self-maintenance remind us strongly=20
of the reports of similar experts in former times, for example,=20
those of the Bavarian medical board on the question of introduc=C2=AC=20
ing the railroad. It is well known that none of the fears of this=20
exalted corporation were later realized: the travelers in the trains=20
of the new =E2=80=98 steam horse =E2=80=99 did not get dizzy, the onlookers=
 did not=20
get sick, and the board fences to hide the new invention from=20
sight were given up =E2=80=94=E2=96=A0 only the board fences around the bra=
ins=20
of all so-called =E2=80=98experts=E2=80=99 were preserved for posterity.=20

In the second place, the following should be noted: every idea,=20
even the best, becomes a danger if it parades as a purpose in it=C2=AC=20
self, being in reality only a means to one. For me and all true=20
National Socialists there is but one doctrine: people and father-=20
land.=20

What we must fight for is to safeguard the existence and reproduc=C2=AC=20
tion of our race and our people, the sustenance of our children and=20
the purity of our blood , the freedom and independence of the father=C2=AC=
=20
land, so that our people may mature for the fulfillment of the mission=20
allotted it by the creator of the universe.=20

Every thought and every idea, every doctrine and all know-=20
ledge, must serve this purpose. And everything must be ex=C2=AC=20
amined from this point of view and used or rejected according to=20


The =E2=80=98Educational Officer'=20


215=20


its utility. Then no theory will stiffen into a dead doctrine, since=20
it is life alone that all things must serve.=20

Thus, it was the conclusions of Gottfried Feder that caused me=20
to delve into the fundamentals of this field with which I had pre=C2=AC=20
viously not been very familiar.=20

I began to study again, and now for the first time really=20
achieved an understanding of the content of the Jew Karl Marx=E2=80=99s=20
life effort. Only now did his Kapilal become really intelligible to=20
me, and also the struggle of the Social Democracy against the=20
national economy, which aims only to prepare the ground for the=20
domination of truly international finance and stock exchange=20
capital=20


W Tv Tr=20


But also in another respect these courses were of the greatest=20
consequence to me.=20

One day I asked for the floor. One of the participants felt ob=C2=AC=20
liged to break a lance for the Jews and began to defend them in=20
lengthy arguments. This aroused me to an answer. The over=C2=AC=20
whelming majority of the students present took my standpoint.=20
The result was that a few days later I was sent into a Munich=20
regiment as a so-called =E2=80=98educational officer.=E2=80=99=20

Discipline among the men was still comparatively weak at that=20
time. It suffered from the after-effects of the period of soldiers=E2=80=99=
=20
councils. Only, very slowly and cautiously was it possible to re=C2=AC=20
place voluntary obedience =E2=80=94 the pretty name that was given=20
to the pig-sty under Kurt Eisner =E2=80=94 by the old military discipline=
=20
and subordination. Accordingly, the men were now expected to=20
learn to feel and think in a national and patriotic way. In these=20
two directions lay the field of my new activity.=20

I started out with the greatest enthusiasm and love. For all at=20
once I was offered an opportunity of speaking before a larger=20
audience; and the thing that I had always presumed from pure=20
feeling without knowing it was now corroborated: I could=20


216=20


Mein Kampf=20


=E2=80=98speak.=E2=80=99 My voice, too, had grown so much better that I cou=
ld=20
be sufficiently understood at least in every corner of the small=20
squad rooms.=20

No task could make me happier than this, for now before being=20
discharged I was able to perform useful services to the institution=20
which had been so close to my heart: the army.=20

And I could boast of some success: in the course of my lectures=20
I led many hundreds, indeed thousands, of comrades back to their=20
people and fatherland. I =E2=80=98nationalized=E2=80=99 the troops and was =
thus=20
also able to help strengthen the general discipline.=20

Here again I became acquainted with a number of like-minded=20
comrades, who later began to form the nucleus of the new move=C2=AC=20
ment.=20


CHAPTER=20

The 'German Workers' Party'=20


n=20

V_-/ne day I received orders from my head=C2=AC=20
quarters to find out what was behind an apparently political=20
organization which was planning to hold a meeting within the=20
next few days under the name of =E2=80=98German Workers=E2=80=99 Party=E2=
=80=99 =E2=80=94=20
with Gottfried Feder as one of the speakers. I was told to go and=20
take a look at the organization and then make a report.=20

The curiosity of the army toward political parties in those days=20
was more than understandable. The revolution had given the=20
soldiers the right of political activity, and it was just the most=20
inexperienced among them who made the most ample use of it.=20
Not until the moment when the Center and the Social Democracy=20
were forced to recognize, to their own grief, that the sympathies=20
of the soldiers were beginning to turn away from the revolution=C2=AC=20
ary parties toward the national movement and reawakening, did=20
they see fit to deprive the troops of suffrage again and prohibit=20
their political activity.=20

It was illuminating that the Center and the Marxists should=20
have taken this measure, for if they had not undertaken this cur=C2=AC=20
tailment of =E2=80=98 civil rights =E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 as the political equ=
ality of the soldiers=20
after the revolution was called =E2=80=94 within a few years there would=20
have been no revolution, and hence no more national dishonor=20
and disgrace. The troops were then well on their way toward=20
ridding the nation of its leeches and the stooges of the Entente=20
within our walls. The fact that the so-called =E2=80=98national* parties=20

voted enthusiastically for the correction of the previous views of=20
the November criminals, and thus helped to blunt the instrument=20
of a national rising, again showed what the eternally doctrinaire=20
ideas of these innocents among innocents can lead to. This=20
bourgeoisie was really suffering from mental senility; in all seri=C2=AC=20
ousness they harbored the opinion that the army would again=20
become what it had been, to wit, a stronghold of German military=20
power; while the Center and Marxism planned only to tear out=20
its dangerous national poison fang, without which, however, an=20
army remains forever a police force, but is not a troop capable=20
of fighting an enemy =E2=80=94 as has been amply proved in the time=20
that followed.=20

Or did our =E2=80=98 national politicians=E2=80=99 believe that the develop=
ment=20
of the army could have been other than national? That would=20
have been confoundedly like the gentlemen and is what comes=20
of not being a soldier in war but a big-mouth; in other words, a=20
parliamentarian with no notion of what goes on in the hearts of=20
men who are reminded by the most colossal past that they were=20
once the best soldiers in the world.=20

And so I decided to attend the above-mentioned meeting of=20
this party which up till then had been entirely unknown to me=20
too.=20

In the evening when I entered the =E2=80=98Leiber Room=E2=80=99 of the form=
er=20
Sterneckerbrau in Munich, I found some twenty to twenty-five=20
people present, chiefly from the lower classes of the population.=20

Feder=E2=80=99s lecture was known to me from the courses, so I was=20
able to devote myself to an inspection of the organization itself.=20

My impression was neither good nor bad; a new organization=20
like so many others. This was a time in which anyone who was=20
not satisfied with developments and no longer had any confidence=20
in the existing parties felt called upon to found a new party.=20
Everywhere these organizations sprang out of the ground, only to=20
vanish silently after a time. The founders for the most part had=20
no idea what it means to make a party =E2=80=94 let alone a movement =E2=80=
=94-=20
out of a club. And so these organizations nearly always stifle=20
automatically in their absurd philistinism.=20


The =E2=80=98German Workers=E2=80=99 Party 7=20


219=20


I judged the =E2=80=98German Workers 7 Party 7 no differently. When=20
Feder finally stopped talking, I was happy. I had seen enough=20
and wanted to leave when the free discussion period, which was=20
now announced, moved me to remain, after all. But here, too,=20
everything seemed to run along insignificantly until suddenly a=20
=E2=80=98professor 7 took the floor; he first questioned the soundness of=
=20
Feder 7 s arguments and then =E2=80=94 after Feder replied very well =E2=80=
=94=20
suddenly appealed to =E2=80=98the facts, 7 but not without recommending=20
most urgently that the young party take up the =E2=80=98 separation 7 of=20
Bavaria from =E2=80=98Prussia 7 as a particularly important program=C2=AC=
=20
matic point. With bold effrontery the man maintained that in=20
this case German-Austria would at once join Bavaria, that the=20
peace would then become much better, and more similar non=C2=AC=20
sense. At this point I could not help demanding the floor and=20
giving the learned gentleman my opinion on this point =E2=80=94 with=20
the result that the previous speaker, even before I was finished,=20
left the hall like a wet poodle. As I spoke, the audience had lis=C2=AC=20
tened with astonished faces, and only as I was beginning to say=20
good night to the assemblage and go away did a man come leaping=20
after me, introduce himself (I had not quite understood his name),=20
and press a little booklet into my hand, apparently a political=20
pamphlet, with the urgent request that I read it.=20

This was very agreeable to me, for now I had reason to hope=20
that I might become acquainted with this dull organization in a=20
simpler way, without having to attend any more such interesting=20
meetings. Incidentally this apparent worker had made a good=20
impression on me. And with this I left the hall.=20

At that time I was still living in the barracks of the Second=20
Infantry Regiment in a little room that still very distinctly bore=20
the traces of the revolution. During the day I was out, mostly=20
with the Forty-First Rifle Regiment, or at meetings, or lectures=20
in some other army unit, etc. Only at night did I sleep in my=20
quarters. Since I regularly woke up before five o=E2=80=99clock in the=20
morning, I had gotten in the habit of putting a few left-overs or=20
crusts of bread on the floor for the mice which amused themselves=20
in my little room, and watching the droll little beasts chasing=20


220=20


Mein Kampf=20


around after these choice morsels. I had known so much poverty=20
in my life that I was well able to imagine the hunger, and hence=20
also the pleasure, of the little creatures.=20

At about five o=E2=80=99clock in the morning after this meeting, I thus=20
lay awake in my cot, watching the chase and bustle. Since I=20
could no longer fall asleep, I suddenly remembered the past=20
evening and my mind fell on the booklet which the worker had=20
given me. I began to read. It was a little pamphlet in which the=20
author, this same worker, described how he had returned to na=C2=AC=20
tional thinking out of the Babel of Marxist and trade-unionist=20
phrases; hence also the title: My Political Awakening} Once I=20
had begun, I read the little book through with interest; for it=20
reflected a process similar to the one which I myself had gone=20
through twelve years before. Involuntarily I saw my own devel=C2=AC=20
opment come to life before my eyes. In the course of the day I=20
reflected a few times on the matter and was finally about to put=20
it aside when, less than a week later, much to my surprise, I re=C2=AC=20
ceived a postcard saying that I had been accepted in the German=20
Workers=E2=80=99 Party; I was requested to express myself on the subject=20
and for this purpose to attend a committee meeting of this party=20
on the following Wednesday.=20

I must admit that I was astonished at this way of =E2=80=98 winning =E2=80=
=99=20
members and I didn=E2=80=99t know whether to be angry or to laugh. I=20
had no intention of joining a ready-made party, but wanted to=20
found one of my own. What they asked of me was presumptuous=20
and out of the question.=20

I was about to send the gentlemen my answer in writing when=20
curiosity won out and I decided to appear on the appointed day=20
to explain my reasons by word of mouth.=20

1 Anton Drexler, Mein Polilisches Erwachen (Mtinchen, E. Boepple, 1920).=20
Drexler was the founder and leading spirit of the Deutsche Arheiterpartei,=
=20
which Hitler transformed into the National Socialist Party. A mechanic in=
=20
the Munich railroad workshop, he was sickly, uneducated, a poor speaker.=20
His claim to leadership was his idea of winning the German worker for the=
=20
nationalist idea. Soon after Hitler assumed leadership of the party, Drexle=
r=20
was expelled. From 1924 to 1928, he was Vice-President of the Bavarian=20
Diet. In 1930, he became reconciled with Hitler, but never returned to=20
active politics.=20


The =E2=80=98Committee Meeting=E2=80=99=20


221=20


Wednesday came. The tavern in which the said meeting was=20
to take place was the =E2=80=98Aites Rosenbad=E2=80=99 in the Herrenstrasse=
, a=20
very run-down place that no one seemed to stray into more than=20
once in a blue moon. No wonder, in the year 1919 when the menu=20
of even the larger restaurants could offer only the scantiest and=20
most modest allurements. Up to this time this tavern had been=20
totally unknown to me.=20

I went through the ill-lit dining room in which not a soul was=20
sitting, opened the door to the back room, and the =E2=80=98session=E2=80=
=99 was=20
before me. In the dim light of a broken-down gas lamp four=20
young people sat at a table, among them the author of the little=20
pamphlet, who at once greeted me most joyfully and bade me=20
welcome as a new member of the German Workers=E2=80=99 Party.=20

Really, I was somewhat taken aback. As I was now informed=20
that the actual =E2=80=98national chairman=E2=80=99 had not yet arrived, I =
de=C2=AC=20
cided to wait with my declaration. This gentleman finally ap=C2=AC=20
pealed. It was the same who had presided at the meeting in=20
the Sterneckerbrau on the occasion of Feder=E2=80=99s lecture.=20

Meanwhile, I had again become very curious, and waited ex=C2=AC=20
pectantly for what was to come. Now at least I came to know the=20
names of the individual gentlemen. The chairman of the =E2=80=98na=C2=AC=20
tional organization =E2=80=99 was a Herr Harrer, 1 that of the Munich=20
District, Anton Drexler.=20

The minutes of the last meeting were read and the secretary=20
was given a vote of confidence. Next came the treasury report =E2=80=94=20
all in all the association possessed seven marks and fifty pfennigs=20
=E2=80=94 for which the treasurer received a vote of general confidence.=20
This, too, was entered in the minutes. Then the first chairman=20
read the answers to a letter from Kiel, one from Diisseldorf, and=20
one from Berlin, and everyone expressed approval. Next a report=20
was given on the incoming mail: a letter from Berlin, one from=20
Diisseldorf and one from Kiel, whose arrival seemed to be received=20

1 Karl Harrer, reporter on the formerly liberal, at that time German Na=C2=
=AC=20
tionalist Miinchener-Augsburger Abendzeitung. He bore the title of Reichs=
=20
Chairman of the Party. He is described as a club-footed, ungainly figure,=
=20
proletarian and shabbily dressed.=20


222=20


Mein Kampf=20


with great satisfaction. This growing correspondence was inter=C2=AC=20
preted as the best and most visible sign of the spreading impor=C2=AC=20
tance of the German Workers=E2=80=99 Party, and then =E2=80=94 then there w=
as=20
a long deliberation with regard to the answers to be made.=20

Terrible, terrible! This was club life of the worst manner and=20
sort. Was I to join this organization?=20

Next, new memberships were discussed; in other words, my=20
capture was taken up.=20

I now began to ask questions =E2=80=94 but, aside from a few direc=C2=AC=20
tives, there was nothing, no program, no leaflet, no printed matter=20
at all, no membership cards, not even a miserable rubber stamp,=20
only obvious good faith and good intentions.=20

I had stopped smiling, for what was this if not a typical sign of=20
the complete helplessness and total despair of all existing parties,=20
their programs, their purposes, and their activity? The thing=20
that drove these few young people to activity that was out=C2=AC=20
wardly so absurd was only the emanation of their inner voice,=20
which more instinctively than consciously showed them that all=20
parties up till then were suited neither for raising up the German=20
nation nor for curing its inner wounds. I quickly read the typed=20
=E2=80=98directives=E2=80=99 and in them I saw more seeking than knowledge.=
=20
Much was vague or unclear, much was missing, but nothing was=20
present which could not have passed as a sign of a struggling=20
realization.=20

I knew what these men felt: it was the longing for a new move=C2=AC=20
ment w r hich should be more than a party in the previous sense of=20
the woid.=20

That evening when I returned to the barracks I had formed my=20
judgment of this association.=20

I was facing the hardest question of my life: should I join or=20
should I decline?=20

Reason could advise me only to decline, but my feeling left me=20
no rest, and as often as I tried to remember the absurdity of this=20
whole club, my feeling argued for it.=20

I was restless in the days that followed.=20

I began to ponder back and forth. I had long been resolved to=20


A Final Decision=20


223=20


engage in political activity; that this could be done only in a new=20
movement was likewise clear to me; only the impetus to act had=20
hitherto been lacking. I am not one of those people who begin=20
something today and lay it down tomorrow, if possible taking up=20
something else again. This very conviction among others was the=20
main reason why it was so hard for me to make up my mind to=20
join such a new organization. I knew that for me a decision would=20
be for good, with no turning back. For me it was no passing game,=20
but grim earnest. Even then I had an instinctive revulsion to=C2=AC=20
ward men who start everything and never carry anything out.=20
These jacks-of-all-trades were loathsome to me. I regarded the=20
activity of such people as worse than doing nothing.=20

And this way of thinking constituted one of the main reasons=20
why I could not make up my mind as easily as some others do to=20
found a cause which either had to become everything or else=20
would do better not to exist at all.=20

Fate itself now seemed to give me a hint. I should never have=20
gone into one of the existing large parties, and later on I shall go=20
into the reasons for this more closely. This absurd little organiza=C2=AC=
=20
tion with its few members seemed to me to possess the one ad=C2=AC=20
vantage that it had not frozen into an =E2=80=98organization,=E2=80=99 but =
left the=20
individual an opportunity for real personal activity. Here it was=20
still possible to work, and the smaller the movement, the more=20
readily it could be put into the proper form. Here the content,=20
the goal, and the road could still be determined, which in the=20
existing great parties was impossible from the outset.=20

The longer I tried to think it over, the more the conviction=20
grew in me that through just such a little movement the rise of the=20
nation could some day be organized, but never through the politi=C2=AC=20
cal parliamentary parties which clung far too greatly to the old=20
conceptions or even shared in the profits of the new regime. For=20
it was a new philosophy and not a new election slogan that had to=20
be proclaimed.=20

Truly a very grave decision =E2=80=94 to begin transforming this in=C2=AC=
=20
tention into reality!=20

What prerequisites did I myself bring to this task?=20


224=20


Mein Kampf=20


That I was poor and without means seemed to me the most=20
bearable part of it, but it was harder that I was numbered among=20
the nameless, that I was one of the millions whom chance permits=20
to live or summons out of existence without even their closest=20
neighbors condescending to take any notice of it. In addition,=20
there was the difficulty which inevitably arose from my lack of=20
schooling.=20

The so-called =E2=80=98 intelligentsia =E2=80=99 always looks down with a r=
eally=20
limitless condescension on anyone who has not been dragged=20
through the obligatory schools and had the necessary knowledge=20
pumped into him. The question has never been: What are the=20
man=E2=80=99s abilities? but: What has he learned? To these =E2=80=98educat=
ed=E2=80=99=20
people the biggest empty-head, if he is wrapped in enough di=C2=AC=20
plomas, is worth more than the brightest boy who happens to=20
lack these costly envelopes. And so it was easy for me to imagine=20
how this =E2=80=98educated=E2=80=99 world would confront me, and in this I =
erred=20
only in so far as even then I still regarded people as better than=20
in cold reality they for the most part unfortunately are. As they=20
are, to be sure, the exceptions, as everywhere else, shine all the=20
more brightly. Thereby, however, I learned always to distinguish=20
between the eternal students and the men of real ability.=20

After two days of agonized pondering and reflection, I finally=20
came to the conviction that I had to take this step.=20

It was the most decisive resolve of my life. From here there=20
was and could be no turning back.=20

And so I registered as a member of the German Workers=E2=80=99=20
Party and received a provisional membership card with the=20
number 7.=20


CHAPTER=20

X=20


Causes of the Collapse=20


l ' 1=20

JL he extent of the fall of a body is always=20
measured by the distance between its momentary position and=20
the one it originally occupied. The same is true of nations and=20
states. A decisive significance must be ascribed to their previous=20
position or rather elevation. Only what is accustomed to rise=20
above the common limit can fall and crash to a manifest low.=20
This is what makes the collapse of the Reich so hard and terrible=20
for every thinking and feeling man, since it brought a crash from=20
heights which today, in view of the depths of our present degrada-=20
tion, are scarcely conceivable.=20

The very founding of the Reich seemed gilded by the magic of=20
an event which uplifted the entire nation. After a series of in=C2=AC=20
comparable victories, a Reich was born for the sons and grand=C2=AC=20
sons =E2=80=94 a reward for immortal heroism. Whether consciously or=20
unconsciously, it matters not, the Germans all had the feeling=20
that this Reich, which did not owe its existence to the trickery of=20
parliamentary fractions, towered above the measure of other=20
states by the very exalted manner of its founding; for not in the=20
cackling of a parliamentary battle of words, but in the thunder=20
and rumbling of the front surrounding Paris was the solemn act=20
performed: a proclamation of our will, declaring that the Germans,=20
princes and people, were resolved in the future to constitute a=20
Reich and once again to raise the imperial crown to symbolic=20
heights. And this was not done by cowardly murder; no deserters=20




226=20


Mein Kampf=20


and slackers were the founders of the Bismarckian state, but the=20
regiments at the front.=20

This unique birth and baptism of fire in themselves surrounded=20
the Reich with a halo of historic glory such as only the oldest=20
states =E2=80=94 and they but seldom =E2=80=94 could boast.=20

And what an ascent now began!=20

Freedom on the outside provided daily bread within. The na=C2=AC=20
tion became rich in numbers and earthly goods. The honor of the=20
state, and with it that of the whole people, was protected and=20
shielded by an army which could point most visibly to the differ=C2=AC=20
ence from the former German Union.=20

So deep is the downfall of the Reich and the German people=20
that everyone, as though seized by dizziness, seems to have lost=20
feeling and consciousness; people can scarcely remember the=20
former height, so dreamlike and unreal do the old greatness and=20
glory seem compared to our present-day misery. Thus it is under=C2=AC=20
standable that people are so blinded by the sublime that they=20
forget to look for the omens of the gigantic collapse which must=20
after all have been somehow present.=20

Of course, this applies only to those for whom Germany was=20
more than a mere stop-over for making and spending money,=20
since they alone can feel the present condition as a collapse, while=20
to the others it is the long-desired fulfillment of their hitherto=20
unsatisfied desires.=20

The omens were then present and visible, though but very few=20
attempted to draw a certain lesson from them.=20

Yet today this is more necessary than ever.=20

The cure of a sickness can only be achieved if its cause is known,=20
and the same is true of curing political evils. To be sure, the=20
outward form of a sickness, its symptom which strikes the eye, is=20
easier to see and discover than the inner cause. And this is the=20
reason why so many people never go beyond the recognition of=20
external effects and even confuse them with the cause, attempt=C2=AC=20
ing, indeed, to deny the existence of the latter. Thus most of us=20
primarily see the German collapse only in the general economic=20
misery and the consequences arising therefrom. Nearly every one=20


Causes of the Collapse=20


227=20


of us must personally suffer these =E2=80=94 a cogent ground for every=20
individual to understand the catastrophe. Much less does the=20
great mass see the collapse in its political, cultural, ethical, and=20
moral aspect. In this the feeling and understanding of many fail=20
completely.=20

That this should be so among the broad masses may still pass,=20
but for even the circles of the intelligentsia to regard the German=20
collapse as primarily an Economic catastrophe/ which can there=C2=AC=20
fore be cured by economic means, is one of the reasons why a=20
recovery has hitherto been impossible. Only when it is under=C2=AC=20
stood that here, too, economics is only of second or third-rate=20
importance, and the primary role falls to factors of politics,=20
ethics, morality, and blood, will we arrive at an understanding of=20
the present calamity, and thus also be able to find the ways and=20
means for a cure.=20

The question of the causes of the German collapse is, therefore,=20
of decisive importance, particularly for a political movement=20
whose very goal is supposed to be to quell the defeat.=20

But, in such research into the past, we must be very careful not=20
to confuse the more conspicuous effects with the less visible=20
causes.=20

The easiest and hence most widespread explanation of the=20
present misfortune is that it was brought about by the conse=C2=AC=20
quences of the lost War and that therefore the War is the cause=20
of the present evil.=20

There may be many who will seriously believe this nonsense,=20
but there are still more from whose mouth such an explanation=20
can only be a lie and conscious falsehood. This last applies to all=20
those who today feed at the government=E2=80=99s cribs. For didn=E2=80=99t =
the=20
prophets of the revolution again and again point out most ur=C2=AC=20
gently to the people that it was a matter of complete indifference=20
to the broad masses how this War turned out? Did they not, on=20
the contrary, gravely assure us that at most the =E2=80=98big capitalist=E2=
=80=99=20
could have an interest in a victorious end of the gigantic struggle=20
of nations, but never the German people as such, let alone the=20
German worker? Indeed, didn=E2=80=99t these apostles of world concilia-=20


228=20


Mein Kampf=20


lion maintain the exact opposite: didn=E2=80=99t they say that by a=20
German defeat =E2=80=98militarism=E2=80=99 would be destroyed, but that the=
=20
German nation would celebrate its most glorious resurrection?=20
Didn=E2=80=99t these circles glorify the benevolence of the Entente, and=20
didn=E2=80=99t they shove the blame for the whole bloody struggle on=20
Germany? And could they have done this without declaring that=20
even military defeat would be without special consequences for=20
the nation? Wasn=E2=80=99t the whole revolution embroidered with the=20
phrase that it would prevent the victory of the German flag, but=20
that through it the German people would at last begin advancing=20
toward freedom at home and abroad?=20

Will you claim that this was not so, you wretched, lying scoun=C2=AC=20
drels?=20

It takes a truly Jewish effrontery to attribute the blame for the=20
collapse solely to the military defeat when the central organ of all=20
traitors to the nation, the Berlin Vorwarts , wrote that this time=20
the German people must not bring its banner home victorious!=20

And now this is supposed to be the cause of our collapse?=20

Of course, it would be perfectly futile to fight with such forget=C2=AC=20
ful liars. I wouldn=E2=80=99t waste my words on them if unfortunately=20
this nonsense were not parroted by so many thoughtless people,=20
who do not seem inspired by malice or conscious insincerity.=20
Furthermore, these discussions are intended to give our propa=C2=AC=20
ganda fighters an instrument which is very much needed at a=20
time when the spoken word is often twisted in our mouths.=20

Thus we have the following to say to the assertion that the lost=20
War is responsible for the German collapse:=20

Certainly the loss of the War was of terrible importance for the=20
future of our fatherland; however, its loss is not a cause, but itself=20
only a consequence of causes. It was perfectly clear to everyone=20
with insight and without malice that an unfortunate end of this=20
struggle for life and death would inevitably lead to extremely=20
devastating consequences. But unfortunately there were also=20
people who seemed to lack this insight at the right time or who,=20
contrary to their better knowledge, contested and denied this=20
truth. Such for the most part were those who, after the fulfill-=20


The Guilty Parties=20


229=20


ment of their secret wish, suddenly and belatedly became aware=20
of the catastrophe which had been brought about by themselves=20
among others. They are guilty of the collapse =E2=80=94 not the lost=20
War as it suddenly pleases them to say and believe. For its loss=20
was, after all, only the consequence of their activity and not, as=20
they now try to say, the result of =E2=80=98bad=E2=80=99 leadership. The fo=
e did=20
not consist of cowards either; he, too, knew how to die. His num=C2=AC=20
ber from the first day was greater than that of the German army,=20
for he could draw on the technical armament and the arsenals of=20
the whole world; hence the German victories, won for four years=20
against a whole world, must regardless of all heroic courage and=20
=E2=80=98organization/ be attributed solely to superior leadership, and=20
this is a fact which cannot be denied out of existence. The or=C2=AC=20
ganization and leadership of the German army were the mightiest=20
that the earth had ever seen. Their deficiencies lay in the limits of=20
all human adequacy in general.=20

The collapse of this army was not the cause of our present-day=20
misfortune, but only the consequence of other crimes, a conse=C2=AC=20
quence which itself again, it must be admitted, ushered in the=20
beginning of a further and this time visible collapse.=20

The truth of this can be seen from the following:=20

Must a military defeat lead to so complete a collapse of a na=C2=AC=20
tion and a state? Since when is this the result of an unfortunate=20
war? Do peoples perish in consequence of lost wars as such?=20

The answer to this can be very brief: always, when military=20
defeat is the payment meted out to peoples for their inner rotten=C2=AC=20
ness, cowardice, lack of character, in short, unworthiness. If this=20
is not the case, the military defeat will rather be the inspiration=20
of a great future resurrection than the tombstone of a national=20
existence.=20

History offers innumerable examples for the truth of this=20
assertion.=20

Unfortunately, the military defeat of the German people is=20
not an undeserved catastrophe, but the deserved chastisement=20
of eternal retribution. We more than deserved this defeat. It is=20
only the greatest outward symptom of decay amid a whole series=20


230=20


Mein Kampf=20


of inner symptoms, which perhaps had remained hidden and in=C2=AC=20
visible to the eyes of most people, or which like ostriches people=20
did not want to see.=20

Just consider the attendant circumstances amid which the=20
German people accepted this defeat. Didn't many circles express=20
the most shameless joy at the misfortune of the fatherland? And=20
who would do such a thing if he does not really deserve such a=20
punishment? Why, didn't they go even further and brag of hav=C2=AC=20
ing finally caused the front to waver? And it was not the enemy=20
that did this =E2=80=94 no, no, it was Germans who poured such disgrace=20
upon their heads! Can it be said that misfortune struck them=20
unjustly? Since when do people step forward and take the guilt=20
for a war on themselves? And against better knowledge and=20
better judgment!=20

No, and again no. In the way in which the German people=20
received its defeat, we can recognize most clearly that the true=20
cause of our collapse must be sought in an entirely different place=20
from the purely military loss of a few positions or in the failure of=20
an offensive; for if the front as such had really flagged and if its=20
downfall had really encompassed the doom of the fatherland, the=20
German people would have received the defeat quite differently.=20
Then they would have borne the ensuing misfortune with gritted=20
teeth or would have mourned it, overpowered by grief; then all=20
hearts would have been filled with rage and anger toward the=20
enemy who had become victorious through a trick of chance or=20
the will of fate; then, like the Roman Senate, the nation would=20
have received the defeated divisions with the thanks of the=20
fatherland for the sacrifices they had made and besought them=20
not to despair of the Reich. The capitulation would have been=20
signed only with the reason, while the heart even then would have=20
beaten for the resurrection to come.=20

This is how a defeat for which only fate was responsible would=20
have been received. Then people would not have laughed and=20
danced, they would not have boasted of cowardice and glorified=20
the defeat, they would not have scoffed at the embattled troops=20
and dragged their banner and cockade in the mud. But above all:=20


Moral Disarmament oe an Accuser=20


231=20


then we should never have had the terrible state of affairs which=20
prompted a British officer, Colonel Repington, to make the con=C2=AC=20
temptuous statement: =C2=A3 Of the Germans, every third man is a=20
traitor.=E2=80=99 No, this plague would never have been able to rise into=
=20
the stifling flood which for five years now has been drowning the=20
very last remnant of respect for us on the part of the rest of the=20
world.=20

This most of all shows the assertion that the lost War was the=20
cause of the German collapse to be a lie. No, this military col=C2=AC=20
lapse was itself only the consequence of a large number of symp=C2=AC=20
toms of disease and their causes, which even in peacetime were=20
with the German nation. This was the first consequence, catas=C2=AC=20
trophic and visible to all, of an ethical and moral poisoning, of a=20
diminution in the instinct of self-preservation and its precondi=C2=AC=20
tions, which for many years had begun to undermine the founda=C2=AC=20
tions of the people and the Reich.=20

It required the whole bottomless falsehood of the Jews and=20
their Marxist fighting organization to lay the blame for the col=C2=AC=20
lapse on that very man who alone, with superhuman energy and=20
will power, tried to prevent the catastrophe he foresaw and save=20
the nation from its time of deepest humiliation and disgrace.=20
By branding Ludendorff as guilty for the loss of the World War,=20
they took the weapon of moral right from the one dangerous ac=C2=AC=20
cuser who could have risen against the traitors to the fatherland.=20
In this they proceeded on the sound principle that the magnitude=20
of a lie always contains a certain factor of credibility, since the=20
great masses of the people in the very bottom of their hearts tend=20
to be corrupted rather than consciously and purposely evil, and=20
that, therefore, in view of the primitive simplicity of their minds,=20
they more easily fall a victim to a big lie than to a little one, since=20
they themselves lie in little things, but would be ashamed of lies=20
that were too big. Such a falsehood will never enter their heads,=20
and they will not be able to believe in the possibility of such=20
monstrous effrontery and infamous misrepresentation in others;=20
yes, even when enlightened on the subject, they will long doubt=20
and waver, and continue to accept at least one of these causes as=20


232=20


Mein Kamff=20


true. Therefore, something of even the most insolent lie will al=C2=AC=20
ways remain and stick =E2=80=94 a fact which all the great lie-virtuosi=20
and lying-clubs in this world know only too well and also make=20
the most treacherous use of.=20

The foremost connoisseurs of this truth regarding the pos=C2=AC=20
sibilities in the use of falsehood and slander have always been the=20
Jews; for after all, their whole existence is based on one single=20
great lie, to wit, that they are a religious community while=20
actually they are a race =E2=80=94 and what a race! One of the greatest=20
minds of humanity has nailed them forever as such in an eternally=20
correct phrase of fundamental truth: he called them The great=20
masters of the lied And anyone who does not recognize this or=20
does not want to believe it will never in this world be able to help=20
the truth to victory.=20

For the German people it must almost be considered a great=20
good fortune that its period of creeping sickness was suddenly=20
cut short by so terrible a catastrophe, for otherwise the nation=20
would have gone to the dogs more slowly perhaps, but all the=20
more certainly. The disease would have become chronic, while=20
in the acute form of the collapse it at least became clearly and=20
distinctly recognizable to a considerable number of people. It was=20
no accident that man mastered the plague more easily than tuber=C2=AC=20
culosis. The one comes in terrible waves of death that shake hu=C2=AC=20
manity to the foundations, the other slowly and stealthily; the=20
one leads to terrible fear, the other to gradual indifference. The=20
consequence is that man opposed the one with all the ruthlessness=20
of his energy, while he tries to control consumption with feeble=20
means. Thus he mastered the plague, while tuberculosis masters=20
him.=20

Exactly the same is true of diseases of national bodies. If they=20
do not take the form of catastrophe, man slowly begins to get=20
accustomed to them and at length, though it may take some=20
time, perishes all the more certainly of them. And so it is a good=20
fortune =E2=80=94 though a bitter one, to be sure =E2=80=94 when Fate resol=
ves=20
to take a hand in this slow process of putrefaction and with a=20
sudden blow makes the victim visualize the end of his disease.=20


Toxins and Symptoms=20


233=20


For more than once, that is what such a catastrophe amounts to.=20
Then it can easily become the cause of a recovery beginning with=20
the utmost determination.=20

But even in such a case, the prerequisite is again the recognition=20
of the inner grounds which cause the disease in question.=20

Here, too, the most important thing remains the distinction=20
between the causes and the conditions they call forth. This will=20
be all the more difficult, the longer the toxins remain in the na=C2=AC=20
tional body and the more they become an ingredient of it which=20
is taken for granted. For it is easily possible that after a certain=20
time unquestionably harmful poisons will be regarded as an in=C2=AC=20
gredient of one=E2=80=99s own nation or at best will be tolerated as a nece=
s=C2=AC=20
sary evil, so that a search for the alien virus is no longer regarded=20
as necessary.=20

Thus, in the long peace of the pre-War years, certain harmful=20
features had appeared and been recognized as such, though next=20
to nothing was done against their virus, aside from a few excep=C2=AC=20
tions. And here again these exceptions were primarily mani=C2=AC=20
festations of economic life, which struck the consciousness of the=20
individual more strongly than the harmful features in a number=20
of other fields.=20

There were many symptoms of decay which should have=20
aroused serious reflection.=20

# # #=20

With respect to economics, the following should be said:=20

Through the amazing increase in the German population be=C2=AC=20
fore the War, the question of providing the necessary daily bread=20
stepped more and more sharply into the foreground of all political=20
and economic thought and action. Unfortunately, those in power=20
could not make up their minds to choose the only correct solution,=20
but thought they could reach their goal in an easier way. When=20
they renounced the acquisition of new soil and replaced it by the=20
lunacy of world economic conquest, the result was bound to be=20
an industrialization as boundless as it was harmful.=20


234=20


Mein Kampf=20


The first consequence of gravest importance was the weakening=20
of the peasant class. Proportionately as the peasant class dimin=C2=AC=20
ished, the mass of the big city proletariat increased more and=20
more, until finally the balance was completely upset.=20

Now the abrupt alternation 1 between rich and poor became=20
really apparent. Abundance and poverty lived so close together=20
that the saddest consequences could and inevitably did arise.=20
Poverty and frequent unemployment began to play havoc with=20
people, leaving behind them a memory of discontent and embit-=20
terment. The consequence of this seemed to be political class=20
division. Despite all the economic prosperity, dissatisfaction=20
became greater and deeper; in fact, things came to such a pass=20
that the conviction that =E2=80=98it can't go on like this much longer'=20
became general, yet without people having or being able to have=20
any definite idea of what ought to have been done.=20

These were the typical symptoms of deep discontent which=20
sought to express themselves in this way.=20

But worse than this were other consequences induced by the=20
economization of the nation.=20

In proportion as economic life grew to be the dominant mistress=20
of the state, money became the god whom all had to serve and=20
to whom each man had to bow down. More and more, the gods=20
of heaven were put into the corner as obsolete and outmoded, and=20
in their stead incense was burned to the idol Mammon. A truly=20
malignant degeneration set in; what made it most malignant was=20
that it began at a time when the nation, in a presumably menac=C2=AC=20
ing and critical hour, needed the highest heroic attitude. Ger=C2=AC=20
many had to accustom herself to the idea that some day her at=C2=AC=20
tempt to secure her daily bread by means of =E2=80=98peaceful economic=20
labor' would have to be defended by the sword.=20

Unfortunately, the domination of money was sanctioned even=20
by that authority which should have most opposed it: His Ma=C2=AC=20
jesty the Kaiser acted most unfortunately by drawing the aris=C2=AC=20
tocracy into the orbit of the new finance capital. It must be said=20
to his credit, however, that unfortunately even Bismarck himself=20

1 ( der schrojje Weeks eld=20


Internationalization Through Finance 235=20


did not recognize the menacing danger in this respect. Thereby=20
the ideal virtues for all practical purposes had taken a position=20
second to the value of money, for it was clear that once a begin=C2=AC=20
ning had been made in this direction, the aristocracy of the sword=20
would in a short time inevitably be overshadowed by the financial=20
aristocracy. Financial operations succeed more easily than=20
battles. It was no longer inviting for the real hero or statesman=20
to be brought into relations with some old bank Jew: the man of=20
true merit could no longer have an interest in the bestowal of=20
cheap decorations; he declined them with thanks. But regarded=20
purely from the standpoint of blood, such a development was=20
profoundly unfortunate: more and more, the nobility lost the=20
racial basis for its existence, and in large measure the designation=20
of =E2=80=98ignobility=E2=80=99 would have been more suitable for it.=20

A grave economic symptom of decay was the slow disappearance of=20
the right of private property , and the gradual transference of the entire=
=20
economy to the ownership of stock companies .=20

Now for the first time labor had sunk to the level of an object=20
of speculation for unscrupulous Jewish business men; the aliena=C2=AC=20
tion of property from the wage-worker was increased ad infinitum.=20
The stock exchange began to triumph and prepared slowly but=20
surely to take the life of the nation into its guardianship and=20
control.=20

The internationalization of the German economic life had been=20
begun even before the War through the medium of stock issues.=20
To be sure, a part of German industry still attempted with resolu=C2=AC=20
tion to ward off this fate. At length, however, it, too, fell a victim=20
to the united attack of greedy finance capital which carried on=20
this fight, with the special help of its most faithful comrade, the=20
Marxist movement.=20

The lasting war against German =E2=80=98heavy industry=E2=80=99 was the=20
visible beginning of the internationalization of German economy=20
toward which Marxism was striving, though this could not be=20
carried to its ultimate end until the victory of Marxism and the=20
revolution. While I am writing these words, the general attack=20

highest goals.=20

How far this =E2=80=98 economization =E2=80=99 of the German people had suc=
=C2=AC=20
ceeded is most visible in the fact that after the War one of the=20
leading heads of German industry, and above all of commerce,=20
was finally able to express the opinion that economic effort as=20
such was alone in a position to re-establish Germany. This non=C2=AC=20
sense was poured forth at a moment when France was primarily=20
bringing back the curriculum of her schools to humanistic founda=C2=AC=20
tions in order to combat the error that the nation and the state=20
owed their survival to economics and not to eternal ideal values.=20
These words pronounced by a Stinnes created the most incredible=20
confusion; they were picked up at once, and with amazing rapid=C2=AC=20
ity became the leitmotiv of all the quacks and big-mouths that=20

One of the worst symptoms of decay in Germany of the pre-War=20
era was the steadily increasing habit of doing things by halves . This=20
is always a consequence of uncertainty on some matter and of the=20
cowardice resulting from this and other grounds. This disease=20
was further promoted by education.=20

1 On April 16, 1924, the German government accepted the Dawes Plan=20
providing for reparations payments beginning at 1,000,000,000 marks an=C2=
=AC=20
nually and increasing to 2,500,000,000 marks at the end of five years. It=
=20
provided for a reorganization of the Reichsbank under Allied supervision.=
=20

By the terms of the Plan, the German railway system had to pay 11,000,-=20
000,000 marks of the reparations debt, or, at 6 per cent, 660,000,000 marks=
=20
annually. The railways, which had been nationalized by the Republic, were=

of the railways.=20

German education before the War was afflicted with an ex=C2=AC=20
traordinary number of weaknesses. It was extremely one-sided=20
and adapted to breeding pure =E2=80=98 knowledge/ with less attention to=20
=E2=80=98ability/ Even less emphasis was laid on the development of the=20
character of the individual =E2=80=94 in so far as this is possible; exceed=
=C2=AC=20
ingly little on the sense of joy in responsibility, and none at all on=20
the training of will and force of decision. Its results, you may be=20
sure, were not strong men, but compliant =E2=80=98walking encyclopedias/=20
as we Germans were generally looked upon and accordingly esti=C2=AC=20
mated before the War. People liked the German because he was=20
easy to make use of, but respected him little, precisely because of=20
his weakness of will. It was not for nothing that more than al=C2=AC=20
most any other people he was prone to lose his nationality and=20
fatherland. The lovely proverb, =E2=80=98with hat in hand, he travels all=
=20
about the land/ 1 tells the whole story.=20

This compliance became really disastrous, however, when it=20
determined the sole form in which the monarch could be ap =E2=80=A2=20
proached; that is, never to contradict him, but agree to anything=20
and everything that His Majesty condescends to do. Precisely in=20
this place was free, manly dignity most necessary; otherwise the=20
monarchic institution was one day bound to perish from all this=20

never and can never be a sneak and a spineless lickspittle. Any=C2=AC=20
one who is really serious about the preservation and furtherance=20
of an institution will cling to it with the last fiber of his heart and=20
will not be able to abandon it if evils of some sort appear in this=20
institution. To be sure, he will not cry this out to the whole=20
public as the democratic =E2=80=98friends=E2=80=99 of the monarchy did in t=
he=20
exact same lying way; he will most earnestly warn and attempt=20
to influence His Majesty, the bearer of the crown himself. He=20
will not and must not adopt the attitude that His Majesty re=C2=AC=20
mains free to act according to his own will anyway, even if this=20
obviously must and will lead to a catastrophe, but in such a case=20
he will have to protect the monarchy against the monarch, and=20
this despite all perils. If the value of this institution lay in the=20
momentary person of the monarch, it would be the worst institu=C2=AC=20
tion that can be imagined; for monarchs only in the rarest cases=20
are the cream of wisdom and reason or even of character, as some=20
people like to claim. This is believed only by professional lick=C2=AC=20

will only feel repelled by the idea of arguing such nonsense. For=20
them history remains history and the truth the truth even where=20
monarchs are concerned. No, the good fortune to possess a great=20
monarch who is also a great man falls to peoples so seldom that=20
they must be content if the malice of Fate abstains at least from=20
the worst possible mistakes.=20

Consequently, the value and importance of the monarchic=20
idea cannot reside in the person of the monarch himself except if=20
Heaven decides to lay the crown on the brow of a heroic genius=20
like Frederick the Great or a wise character like William I. This=20
happens once in centuries and hardly more often. Otherwise the=20
idea takes precedence over the person and the meaning of this=20
institution must lie exclusively in the institution itself. With this=20
the monarch himself falls into the sphere of service. Then he, too,=20
becomes a mere cog in this work, to which he is obligated as such.=20
Then he, too, must comply with a higher purpose, and the =E2=80=98 mon=C2=

wise, it would not be permissible to depose an obviously insane=20
prince, if the sense of the institution lay not in the idea, but in the=20
=E2=80=98sanctified=E2=80=99 person at any price.=20

Today it is really necessary to put this down, for in recent times=20
more and more of these creatures, to whose wretched attitude the=20
collapse of the monarchy must not least of all be attributed are=20
rising out of obscurity. With a certain naive gall, these people=20
have started in again to speak of nothing but =E2=80=98 their King=E2=80=99=
 =E2=80=94=20
whom only a few years ago they left in the lurch in the critical=20
hour and in the most despicable fashion =E2=80=94 and are beginning to=20
represent every person who is not willing to agree to their lying=20
tirades as a bad German. And in reality they are the very same=20
poltroons who in 1919 scattered and ran from every red arm-=20

will appear, and the whole gang of ghosts profiting from the old=20
monarchy will again vanish like mice at the sight of a cat!=20

If the monarchs were not themselves to blame for these things,=20
they could be most heartily pitied because of their present de=C2=AC=20
fenders. In any case, they might as well know that with such=20
knights a crown can be lost, but no crowns gained.=20

This servility, however, was a flaw in our whole education, for=20
which w T e suffered most terribly in this connection. For, as its=20
consequence, these wretched creatures were able to maintain=20
themselves at all the courts and gradually undermine the founda=C2=AC=20
tions of the monarchy. And when the structure finally began to=20

Mein Kampf=20


totter, they evaporated. Naturally: cringers and lickspittles do=20
not let themselves be knocked dead for their master. That mon-=20
archs never know this and fail to learn it almost on principle has=20
from time immemorial been their undoing.=20


7T *=20


One of the worst symptoms of decay was the increasing cowardice=20
in the face of responsibility, as well as the resultant half-heartedness=20
in all things.=20

To be sure, the starting point of this plague in our country lies=20
in large part in the parliamentary institution in which irrespon=C2=AC=20
sibility of the purest breed is cultivated. Unfortunately, this=20
plague slowly spread to all other domains of life, most strongly to=20
state life. Everywhere responsibility was evaded and inadequate=20
half-measures were preferred as a result; for in the use of such=20
measures personal responsibility seems reduced to the smallest=20
dimensions.=20

Just examine the attitude of the various governments toward=20
a number of truly injurious manifestations of our public life, and=20
you will easily recognize the terrible significance of this general=20
half-heartedness and cowardice in the face of responsibility.=20

I shall take only a few cases from the mass of existing ex=C2=AC=20
amples:=20

Journalistic circles in particular like to describe the press as a=20
=E2=80=98great power=E2=80=99 in the state. As a matter of fact, its import=
ance=20
really is immense. It cannot be overestimated, for the press really=20
continues education in adulthood.=20

Its readers, by and large, can be divided into three groups:=20

First, into those who believe everything they read;=20

second, into those who have ceased to believe anything;=20

third, into the minds which critically examine what they read,=20
and judge accordingly.=20

Numerically, the first group is by far the largest. It consists=20
of the great mass of the people and consequently represents the=20


Three Groups of Newspaper Readers=20


241=20


simplest-minded part of the nation. It cannot be listed in terms=20
of professions, but at most in general degrees of intelligence. To=20
it belong all those who have neither been born nor trained to=20
think independently, and who partly from incapacity and partly=20
from incompetence believe everything that is set before them in=20
black and white. To them also belongs the type of lazybones who=20
could perfectly well think, but from sheer mental laziness seizes=20
gratefully on everything that someone else has thought, with the=20
modest assumption that the someone else has exerted himself=20
considerably. Now, with all these types, who constitute the great=20
masses, the influence of the press will be enormous. They are not=20
able or willing themselves to examine what is set before them, and=20
as a result their whole attitude toward all the problems of the=20
day can be reduced almost exclusively to the outside influence of=20
others. This can be advantageous when their enlightenment is=20
provided by a serious and truth-loving party, but it is cata=C2=AC=20
strophic when scoundrels and liars provide it.=20

The second group is much smaller in number. It is partly com=C2=AC=20
posed of elements which previously belonged to the first group,=20
but after long and bitter disappointments shifted to the opposite=20
and no longer believe anything that comes before their eyes in=20
print. They hate every newspaper; either they don't read it at=20
all, or without exception fly into a rage over the contents, since in=20
their opinion they consist only of lies and falsehoods. These=20
people are very hard to handle, since they are suspicious even in=20
the face of the truth. Consequently, they are lost for all positive,=20
political work.=20

The third group, finally, is by far the smallest; it consists of the=20
minds with real mental subtlety, whom natural gifts and educa=C2=AC=20
tion have taught to think independently, who try to form their=20
own judgment on all things, and who subject everything they=20
read to a thorough examination and further development of their=20
own. They will not look at a newspaper without always col=C2=AC=20
laborating in their minds, and the writer has no easy time of it.=20
Journalists love such readers with the greatest reserve.=20

For the members of this third group, it must be admitted, the=20


242=20


Mein Kampf=20


nonsense that newspaper scribblers can put down is not very=20
dangerous or even very important. Most of them in the course=20
of their lives have learned to regard every journalist as a rascal=20
on principle, who tells the truth only once in a blue moon. Un=C2=AC=20
fortunately, however, the importance of these splendid people=20
lies only in their intelligence and not in their number =E2=80=94 a mis=C2=
=AC=20
fortune at a time when wisdom is nothing and the majority is=20
everything! Today, when the ballot of the masses decides, the=20
chief weight lies with the most numerous group, and this is the=20
first: the mob of the simple or credulous.=20

It is of paramount interest to the state and the nation to pre=C2=AC=20
vent these people from falling into the hands of bad, ignorant, or=20
even vicious educators. The state, therefore, has the duty of=20
watching over their education and preventing any mischief. It=20
must particularly exercise strict control over the press; for its=20
influence on these people is by far the strongest and most pene =C2=AC=20
trating, since it is applied, not once in a while, but over and over=20
again. In the uniformity and constant repetition of this instruc=C2=AC=20
tion lies its tremendous power. If anywhere, therefore, it is here=20
that the state must not forget that all means must serve an end;=20
it must not let itself be confused by the drivel about so-called=20
=E2=80=98freedom of the press=E2=80=99 and let itself be talked into neglec=
ting its=20
duty and denying the nation the food which it needs and which is=20
good for it; with ruthless determination it must make sure of this=20
instrument of popular education, and place it in the service of=20
the state and the nation.=20

But what food did the German press of the pre-War period dish=20
out to the people? Was it not the worst poison that can even be=20
imagined? Wasn=E2=80=99t the worst kind of pacifism injected into the=20
heart of our people at a time when the rest of the world was pre=C2=AC=20
paring to throttle Germany, slowly but surely? Even in peace=C2=AC=20
time didn=E2=80=99t the press inspire the minds of the people with doubt=20
in the right of their own state, thus from the outset limiting them=20
in the choice of means for its defense? Was it not the German=20
press which knew how to make the absurdity of =E2=80=98Western de=C2=AC=20
mocracy=E2=80=99 palatable to our people until, finally, ensnared by all=20


State and Press=20


243=20


the enthusiastic tirades, they thought they could entrust their=20
future to a League of Nations? Did it not help to teach our people=20
a miserable immorality? Did it not ridicule morality and ethics=20
as backward and petty-bourgeois, until our people finally became=20
=E2=80=98modern=E2=80=99? Did it not with its constant attacks undermine th=
e=20
foundations of the state=E2=80=99s authority until a single thrust sufficed=
=20
to make the edifice collapse? Did it not fight with all possible=20
means against every effort to give unto the state that which is the=20
state=E2=80=99s? Did it not belittle the army with constant criticism,=20
sabotage universal conscription, demand the refusal of military=20
credits, etc., until the result became inevitable?=20

The so-called liberal press was actively engaged in digging the=20
grave of the German people and the German Reich. We can pass=20
by the lying Marxist sheets in silence; to them lying is just as=20
vitally necessary as catching mice for a cat; their function is only=20
to break the people=E2=80=99s national and patriotic backbone and make=20
them ripe for the slave=E2=80=99s yoke of international capital and its=20
masters, the Jews,=20

And what did the state do against this mass poisoning of the=20
nation? Nothing, absolutely nothing. A few ridiculous decrees,=20
a few fines for villainy that went too far, and that was the end of=20
it. Instead, they hoped to curry favor with this plague by flattery,=20
by recognition of the =E2=80=98value=E2=80=99 of the press, its =E2=80=98im=
portance,=E2=80=99 its=20
=E2=80=98educational mission,=E2=80=99 and more such nonsense =E2=80=94 as =
for the Jews,=20
they took all this with a crafty smile and acknowledged it with=20
sly thanks.=20

The reason, however, for this disgraceful failure on the part=20
of the state was not that it did not recognize the danger, but=20
rather in a cowardice crying to high Heaven and the resultant=20
half-heartedness of all decisions and measures. No one had the=20
courage to use thoroughgoing radical methods, but in this as in=20
everything else they tinkered about with a lot of halfway pre=C2=AC=20
scriptions, and instead of carrying the thrust to the heart, they at=20
most irritated the viper =E2=80=94 with the result that not only did every=
=C2=AC=20
thing remain as before, but on the contrary the power of the in=C2=AC=20
stitutions which should have been combated increased from year=20
to year.=20


=E2=9C=93=20


244=20


Mein Kampf=20


The defensive struggle of the German government at that time=20
against the press =E2=80=94 mainly that of Jewish origin =E2=80=94 which wa=
s=20
slowly ruining the nation was without any straight line, irresolute=20
and above all without any visible goal. The intelligence of the=20
privy councilors failed completely when it came to estimating=20
the importance of this struggle, to choosing means or drawing up=20
a clear plan. Planlessly they fiddled about; sometimes, after be=C2=AC=20
ing bitten too badly, they locked up one of the journalistic vipers=20
for a few weeks or months, but they left the snakes=E2=80=99 nest as such=
=20
perfectly unmolested.=20

True =E2=80=94 this resulted partly from the infinitely wily tactics of=20
the Jews, on the one hand, and from a stupidity and innocence=20
such as only privy councilors are capable of, on the other. The=20
Jew was much too clever to allow his entire press to be attacked=20
uniformly. No, one part of it existed in order to cover the other.=20
While the Marxist papers assailed in the most dastardly way=20
everything that can be holy to man; while they infamously at=C2=AC=20
tacked the state and the government and stirred up large sections=20
of the people against one another, the bourgeois-democratic=20
papers knew how to give an appearance of their famous ob=C2=AC=20
jectivity, painstakingly avoided all strong words, well knowing=20
that empty heads can judge only by externals and never have the=20
faculty of penetrating the inner core, so that for them the value=20
of a thing is measured by this exterior instead of by the content;=20
a human weakness to which they owe what esteem they them=C2=AC=20
selves enjoy.=20

For these people the Frankfurter Zeitung was the embodiment=20
of respectability. For it never uses coarse expressions, it rejects=20
all physical brutality and keeps appealing for struggle with =E2=80=98in=C2=
=AC=20
tellectual=E2=80=99 weapons, a conception, strange to say, to which espe=C2=
=AC=20
cially the least intelligent people are most attached. This is a=20
result of our half-education which removes people from the in=C2=AC=20
stinct of Nature and pumps a certain amount of knowledge into=20
them, but cannot create full understanding, since for this in=C2=AC=20
dustry and good will alone are no use; the necessary intelligence=20
must be present, and what is more, it must be inborn. The ulti-=20


The Respectable Press=20


245=20


mate wisdom is always the understanding of the instinct 1 =E2=80=94 that=20
is: a man must never fall into the lunacy of believing that he has=20
really risen to be lord and master of Nature =E2=80=94 which is so easily=
=20
induced by the conceit of half-education; he must understand the=20
fundamental necessity of Nature=E2=80=99s rule, and realize how much his=20
existence is subjected to these laws of eternal fight and upward=20
struggle. Then he will feel that in a universe where planets re=C2=AC=20
volve around suns, and moons turn about planets, where force=20
alone forever masters weakness, compelling it to be an obedient=20
slave or else crushing it, there can be no special laws for man. For=20
him, too, the eternal principles of this ultimate wisdom hold sway.=20
He can try to comprehend them; but escape them, never.=20

And it is precisely for our intellectual demi-monde that the Jew=20
writes his so-called intellectual press. For them the Frankfurter=20
Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt are made; for them their tone=20
is chosen, and on them they exercise their influence. Seemingly=20
they all most sedulously avoid any outwardly crude forms, and=20
meanwhile from other vessels they nevertheless pour their poison=20
into the hearts of their readers. Amid a Gezeires 2 of fine sounds=20
and phrases they lull their readers into believing that pure science=20
or even morality is really the motive of their acts, while in reality=20
it is nothing but a wily, ingenious trick for stealing the enemy=E2=80=99s=
=20
weapon against the press from under his nose. The one variety=20
oozes respectability, so all soft-heads are ready to believe them=20
when they say that the faults of others are only trivial abuses,=20
which should never lead to an infringement of the =E2=80=98freedom of=20
the press =E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 their term for poisoning and lying to the peo=
ple.=20
And so the authorities shy away from taking measures against=20
these bandits, for they fear that, if they did, they would at once=20
have the =E2=80=98 respectable =E2=80=99 press against them, a fear which i=
s only too=20
justified. For as soon as they attempt to proceed against one of=20
these shameful rags, all the others will at once take its part, but=20

of all this shouting, the strongest men grow weak, for does it not=20
issue from the mouths of =E2=80=98 respectable=E2=80=99 papers?=20

This poison was able to penetrate the bloodstream of our people=20
unhindered and do its work, and the state did not possess the=20
power to master the disease. In the laughable half-measures=20
which it used against the poison, the menacing decay of the Reich=20
was manifest. For an institution which is no longer resolved to de=C2=AC=20
fend itself with all weapons has for practical purposes abdicated.=20
Every half-measure is a visible sign of inner decay which must and=20
will be followed sooner or later by outward collapse.=20

I believe that the present generation, properly led,.will more=20
easily master this danger. It has experienced various things which=20
had the power somewhat to strengthen the nerves of those who=20
did not lose them entirely. In future days the Jew. will certainly=20
continue to raise a mighty uproar in his newspapers if a hand is=20
ever laid on his favorite nest, if an end is put to the mischief of=20
the press and this instrument of education is put into the service=20
of the state and no longer left in the hands of aliens and enemies=20
of the people. But I believe that this will bother us younger men=20
less than our fathers. A thirty-centimeter shell has alwa)^s hissed=20
more loudly than a thousand Jewish newspaper vipers =E2=80=94 so let=20

A further example of the half-heartedness and weakness of the=20
leaders of pre-War Germany in meeting the most important vital=20
questions of the nation is the following: running parallel to the=20
political, ethical, and moral contamination of the people, there=20
had been for many years a no less terrible poisoning of the health=20
of the national body. Especially in the big cities, syphilis was=20
beginning to spread more and more, while tuberculosis steadily=20


Syphilis=20


247=20


reaped its harvest of death throughout nearly the whole country.=20

Though in both cases the consequences were terrible for the=20
nation, the authorities could not summon up the energy to take=20
decisive measures.=20

Particularly with regard to syphilis, the attitude of the leader=C2=AC=20
ship of the nation and the state can only be designated as total=20
capitulation. To fight it seriously, they would have had to take=20
somewhat broader measures than was actually the case. The=20
invention of a remedy of questionable character and its com=C2=AC=20
mercial exploitation can no longer help much against this plague.=20
Here again it was only the fight against causes that mattered and=20
not the elimination of the symptoms. The cause lies, primarily,=20
in our prostitution of love. Even if its result were not this fright=C2=AC=
=20
ful plague, it would nevertheless be profoundly injurious to man,=20
since the moral devastations which accompany this degeneracy=20
suffice to destroy a people slowly but surely. This Jewification of=20
our spiritual life and mammonization of our mating instinct will=20
sooner or later destroy our entire offspring, for the powerful=20
children of a natural emotion will be replaced by the miserable=20
creatures of financial expediency which is becoming more and=20
more the basis and sole prerequisite of our marriages. Love finds=20
its outlet elsewhere.=20

Here, too, of course, Nature can be scorned for a certain time,=20
but her vengeance will not fail to appear, only it takes a time to=20
manifest itself, or rather: it is often recognized too late by man.=20

But the devastating consequences of a lasting disregard of the=20
natural requirements for marriage can be seen in our nobility.=20
Here we have before us the results of procreation based partly on=20
purely social compulsion and partly on financial grounds. The=20
one leads to a general weakening, the other to a poisoning of the=20
blood, since every department store Jewess is considered fit to=20
augment the offspring of His Highness =E2=80=94 and, indeed, the off=C2=AC=
=20
spring look it. In both cases complete degeneration is the con=C2=AC=20
sequence.=20

Today our bourgeoisie strive to go the same road, and they=20
will end up at the same goal.=20


248=20


Mein Kampf=20


Hastily and indifferently, people tried to pass by the unpleasant=20
truths, as though by such an attitude events could be undone.=20
No, the fact that our big city population is growing more and=20
more prostituted in its love life cannot just be denied out of ex=C2=AC=20
istence; it simply is so. The most visible results of this mass con=C2=AC=
=20
tamination can, on the one hand, be found in the insane asylums,=20
and on the other, unfortunately, in our =E2=80=94 children. They in=20
particular are the sad product of the irresistibly spreading con=C2=AC=20
tamination of our sexual life; the vices of the parents are revealed=20
in the sicknesses of the children.=20

There are different ways of reconciling oneself to this un=C2=AC=20
pleasant, yes, terrible fact: the ones see nothing at all or rather=20
want to see nothing; this, of course, is by far the simplest and=20
easiest position.=E2=80=99 The others wrap themselves in a saint=E2=80=99s =
cloak=20
of prudishness as absurd as it is hypocritical; they speak of this=20
whole field as if it were a great sin, and above all express their=20
profound indignation against every sinner caught in the act, then=20
close their eyes in pious horror to this godless plague and pray=20
God to let sulphur and brimstone =E2=80=94 preferably after their own=20
death =E2=80=94 rain down on this whole Sodom and Gomorrah, thus=20
once again making an instructive example of this shameless hu=C2=AC=20
manity. The third, finally, are perfectly well aware of the ter=C2=AC=20
rible consequences which this plague must and will some day=20
induce, but only shrug their shoulders, convinced that nothing=20
can be done against the menace, so the only thing to do is to let=20
things slide.=20

All this, to be sure, is comfortable and simple, but it must not=20
be forgotten that a nation will fall victim to such comfortableness.=20
The excuse that other peoples are no better off, it goes without=20
saying, can scarcely affect the fact of our own ruin, except that=20
the feeling of seeing others stricken by the same calamity might=20
for many bring a mitigation of their own pains. But then more=20
than ever the question becomes: Which people will be the first and=20
only one to master this plague by its own strength, and which=20
nations will perish from it? And this is the crux of the whole mat=C2=AC=20
ter. Here again we have a touchstone of a race=E2=80=99s value =E2=80=94 th=
e race=20


Blood Sin and Desecration of the Race=20


249=20


which cannot stand the test will simply die out, making place for=20
healthier or tougher and more resisting races. For since this ques=C2=AC=20
tion primarily regards the offspring, it is one of those concerning=20
which it is said with such terrible justice that the sins of the=20
fathers are avenged down to the tenth generation. But this ap=C2=AC=20
plies only to profanation of the blood and the race.=20

Blood sin and desecration of the race are the original sin in this=20
world and the end of a humanity which surrenders to it.=20

How truly wretched was the attitude of pre-War Germany on=20
this one very question! What was done to check the contamina=C2=AC=20
tion of our youth in the big cities? What was done to attack the=20
infection and mammonization of our love life? What was done=20
to combat the resulting syphilization of our people?=20

This can be answered most easily by stating what should have=20
been done.=20

First of all, it was not permissible to take this question friv=C2=AC=20
olously; it had to be understood that the fortune or misfortune=20
of generations would depend on its solution; yes, that it could, if=20
not had to be, decisive for the entire future of our people. Such a=20
realization, however, obligated us to ruthless measures and=20
surgical operations. What we needed most was the conviction=20
that first of all the whole attention of the nation had to be con=C2=AC=20
centrated upon this terrible danger, so that every single individual=20
could become inwardly conscious of the importance of this strug=C2=AC=20
gle. Truly incisive and sometimes almost unbearable obligations=20
and burdens can only be made generally effective if, in addition=20
to compulsion, the realization of necessity is transmitted to the=20
individual. But this requires a tremendous enlightenment ex=C2=AC=20
cluding all other problems of the day which might have a dis=C2=AC=20
tracting effect.=20

In all cases where the fulfillment of apparently impossible de=C2=AC=20
mands or tasks is involved , the whole attention of a people must be=20
focused and concentrated on this one question , as though life and=20
death actually depended on its solution . Only in this way will a=20
people be made willing and able to perform great tasks and=20
exertions.=20


250=20


Mein Kampf=20


This principle applies also to the individual man in so far as=20
he wants to achieve great goals. He, too, will be able to do this=20
only in steplike sections, and he, too, will always have to unite=20
his entire energies on the achievement of a definitely delimited=20
task, until this task seems fulfilled and a new section can be=20
marked out. Anyone who does not so divide the road to be con=C2=AC=20
quered into separate stages and does not try to conquer these one=20
by one, systematically with the sharpest concentration of all his=20
forces, will never be able to reach the ultimate goal, but will be=20
left lying somewhere along the road, or perhaps even off it. This=20
gradual working up to a goal is an art, and to conquer the road=20
step by step in this way you must throw in your last ounce of energy.=20

The very first prerequisite needed for attacking such a difficult=20
stretch of the human road is for the leadership to succeed in=20
representing to the masses of the people the partial goal which=20
now has to be achieved, or rather conquered, as the one which is=20
solely and alone worthy of attention, on whose conquest every=C2=AC=20
thing depends. The great mass of the people cannot see the whole=20
road ahead of them without growing weary and despairing of the=20
task. A certain number of them will keep the goal in mind, but=20
will only be able to see. the road in small, partial stretches, like=20
the wanderer, who likewise knows and recognizes the end of his=20
journey, but is better able to conquer the endless highway if he=20
divides it into sections and boldly attacks each one as though it=20
represented the desired goal itself. Only in this way does he ad=C2=AC=20
vance without losing heart.=20

Thus, by the use of all propagandist means, the question of=20
combating syphilis should have been made to appear as the task=20
of the nation. Not just one more task. To this end, its injurious=20
effects should have been thoroughly hammered into people as=20
the most terrible misfortune, and this by the use of all available=20
means, until the entire nation arrived at the conviction that=20
everything =E2=80=94 future or ruin =E2=80=94 depended upon the solution of=
=20
this question.=20

Only after such a preparation, if necessary over a period of=20
years, will the attention, and consequently the determination, of=20


The Task of Combating Syphilis=20


251=20


the entire nation be aroused to such an extent that we can take=20
exceedingly hard measures exacting the greatest sacrifices with=C2=AC=20
out running the risk of not being understood or of suddenly being=20
left in the lurch by the will of the masses.=20

For, seriously to attack this plague, tremendous sacrifices and=20
equally great labors are necessary.=20

The fight against syphilis demands a fight against prostitution,=20
against prejudices, old habits, against previous conceptions, gen=C2=AC=20
eral views among them not least the false prudery of certain=20
circles.=20

The first prerequisite for even the moral right to combat these=20
things is the facilitation of earlier marriage for the coming gen=C2=AC=20
eration. In late marriage alone lies the compulsion to retain an=20
institution which, twist and turn as you like, is and remains a=20
disgrace to humanity, an institution which is damned ill-suited=20
to a being who with his usual modesty likes to regard himself as=20
the =E2=80=98image=E2=80=99 of God.=20

Prostitution is a disgrace to humanity, but it cannot be elim=C2=AC=20
inated by moral lectures, pious intentions, etc.; its limitation and=20
final abolition presuppose the elimination of innumerable pre=C2=AC=20
conditions. The first is and remains the creation of an oppor=C2=AC=20
tunity for early marriage as compatible with human nature =E2=80=94=20
particularly for the man, as the woman in any case is only the=20
passive part.=20

How lost, how incomprehensible a part of humanity has be=C2=AC=20
come today can be seen from the fact that mothers in so-called=20
=E2=80=98good=E2=80=99 society can not seldom be heard to say that they are=
 glad=20
to have found their child a husband who has sown his wild oats,=20
etc. Since there is hardly any lack of these, but rather the con=C2=AC=20
trary, the poor girl will be happy to find one of these worn-out=20
Siegfrieds, 1 and the children will be the visible result of this=20

1 The German here has an untranslatable and rather elaborate pun.=20
To sow wild oats is 1 sich die Horner abstossen,=E2=80=99 to butt off one=
=E2=80=99s horns.=20
The word I have rendered as =E2=80=98worn-out=E2=80=99 is enthornt, literal=
ly de-horned.=20
Siegfried did not have horns, the reference is to the horny skin which=20
made him invulnerable.=20


252=20


Mein Kampf=20


=E2=80=98sensible=E2=80=99 marriage. If we bear in mind that, aside from th=
is,=20
propagation as such is limited as much as possible, so that Nature=20
is prevented from making any choice, since naturally every=20
creature, regardless how miserable, must be preserved, the only=20
question that remains is why such an institution exists at all any=20
more and what purpose it is supposed to serve? Isn=E2=80=99t it exactly=20
the same as prostitution itself? Hasn=E2=80=99t duty toward posterity=20
passed completely out of the picture? Or do people fail to realize=20
what a curse on the part of their children and children=E2=80=99s children=
=20
they are heaping on themselves by such criminal frivolity in=20
observing the ultimate natural law as well as our ultimate natural=20
obligation ? 1=20

Thus, the civilized peoples degenerate and gradually perish.=20

And marriage cannot be an end in itself, but must .serve the=20
one higher goal, the increase and preservation of the species and=20
the race. This alone is its meaning and its task.=20

Under these conditions its soundness can only be judged by the=20
way in which it fulfills this task. For this reason alone early mar=C2=AC=
=20
riage is sound, for it gives the young marriage that strength from=20
which alone a healthy and resistant offspring can arise. To be=20
sure, it can be. made possible only by quite a number of social=20
conditions without which early marriage is not even thinkable.=20
Therefore, a solution of this question, small as it is, cannot occur=20
without incisive measures of a social sort. The importance of=20
these should be most understandable at a time when the =E2=80=98 social =E2=
=80=99=20
republic, if only by its incompetence in the solution of the housing=20
question, simply prevents numerous marriages and thus en=C2=AC=20
courages prostitution.=20

Our absurd way of regulating salaries, which concerns itself=20
much too little with the question of the family and its sustenance,=20
is one more reason that makes many an early marriage im=C2=AC=20
possible.=20

Thus, a real fight against prostitution can only be undertaken=20
if a basic change in social conditions makes possible an earlier=20

Sound Mind =E2=80=94 Sound Body=20


253=20


marriage than at present can generally take place. This is the=20
very first premise for a solution of this question.=20

In the second place, education and training must eradicate a=20
number of evils about which today no one bothers at all. Above=20
all, in our present education a balance must be created between=20
mental instruction and physical training. The institution that is=20
called a Gymnasium today is a mockery of the Greek model. In=20
our educational system it has been utterly forgotten that in the=20
long run a healthy mind can dwell only in a healthy body. Espe=C2=AC=20
cially if we bear in mind the mass of the people, aside from a few=20
exceptions, this statement becomes absolutely valid.=20

In pre-War Germany there was a period in which no one con=C2=AC=20
cerned himself in the least about this truth. They simply went=20
on sinning against the body and thought that in the one-sided=20
training of the =E2=80=98mind,=E2=80=99 they possessed a sure guaranty for =
the=20
greatness of the nation. A mistake whose consequences began to=20
be felt sooner than was expected. It is no accident that the Bol=C2=AC=20
shevistic wave never found better soil than in places inhabited=20
by a population degenerated by hunger and constant under=C2=AC=20
nourishment: in Central Germany, Saxony, and the Ruhr. But in=20
all these districts the so-called intelligentsia no longer offers any=20
serious resistance to this Jewish disease, for the simple reason that=20
this intelligentsia is itself completely degenerate physically,=20
though less for reasons of poverty than for reasons of education.=20
In times when not the mind but the fist decides, the purely intel=C2=AC=20
lectual emphasis of our education in the upper classes makes them=20
incapable of defending themselves, let alone enforcing their will.=20
Not infrequently the first reason for personal cowardice lies in=20
physical weaknesses.=20

The excessive emphasis on purely intellectual instruction and=20
the neglect of physical training also encourage the emergence of=20
sexual ideas at a much too early age. The youth who achieves=20
the hardness of iron by sports and gymnastics succumbs to the=20
need of sexual satisfaction less than the stay-at-home fed ex=C2=AC=20
clusively on intellectual fare. And a sensible system of education=20
must bear this in mind. It must, moreover, not fail to consider=20


254=20


Mein Kampf=20


that the healthy young man will expect different things from the=20
woman than a prematurely corrupted weakling.=20

Thus, the whole system of education must be so organized as=20
to use the boy=E2=80=99s free time for the useful training of his body. He=
=20
has no right to hang about in idleness during these years, to make=20
the streets and movie-houses unsafe; after his day=E2=80=99s work he=20
should steel and harden his young body, so that later life will not=20
find him too soft. To begin this and also carry it out, to direct=20
and guide it, is the task of education, and not just the pumping=20
of so-called wisdom. We must also do away with the conception=20
that the treatment of the body is the affair of every individual.=20
There is no freedom to sin at the cost of posterity and hence of=20
the race.=20

Parallel to the training of the body, a struggle against the poi=C2=AC=20
soning of the soul must begin. Our whole public life today is like=20
a hothouse for sexual ideas and stimulations. Just look at the bill=20
of fare served up in our movies, vaudeville and theaters, and you=20
will hardly be able to deny that this is not the right kind of food,=20
particularly for the youth. In shop windows and billboards the=20
vilest means are used to attract the attention of the crowd.=20
Anyone who has not lost the ability to think himself into their=20
soul must realize that this must cause great damage in the youth.=20
This sensual, sultry atmosphere leads to ideas and stimulations at=20
a time when the boy should have no understanding of such things.=20
The result of this kind of education can be studied in present-day=20
youth, and it is not exactly gratifying. They mature too early and=20
consequently grow old before their time. Sometimes the public=20
learns of court proceedings which permit shattering insights into=20
the emotional life of our fourteen- and fifteen-year-olds. Who=20
will be surprised that even in these age-groups syphilis begins to=20
seek its victims? And is it not deplorable to see a good number of=20
these physically weak, spiritually corrupted young men obtaining=20
their introduction to marriage through big-city whores?=20

No, anyone who wants to attack prostitution must first of all=20
help to eliminate its spiritual basis. He must clear away the filth=20
of the moral plague of big-city =E2=80=98 civilization =E2=80=99 and he mus=
t do this=20


Sterilization of Incurables=20


255=20


ruthlessly and without wavering in the face of all the shouting=20
and screaming that will naturally be let loose. If we do not lift=20
the youth out of the morass of their present-day environment,=20
they will drown in it. Anyone who refuses to see these things sup=C2=AC=20
ports them, and thereby makes himself an accomplice in the slow=20
prostitution of our future which, whether we like it or not, lies=20
in the coming generation. This cleansing of our culture must be=20
extended to nearly all fields. Theater, art, literature, cinema,=20
press, posters, and window displays must be cleansed of all mani=C2=AC=20
festations of our rotting world and placed in the service of a moral,=20
political, and cultural idea. Public life must be freed from the=20
stifling perfume of our modern eroticism, just as it must be freed=20
from all unmanly, prudish hypocrisy. In all these things the goal=20
and the road must be determined by concern for the preservation=20
of the health of our people in body and soul. The right of per=C2=AC=20
sonal freedom recedes before the duty to preserve the race.=20

Only after these measures are carried out can the medical strug=C2=AC=20
gle against the plague itself be carried through with any prospect=20
of success. But here, too, there must be no half-measures; the=20
gravest and most ruthless decisions will have to be made. It is a=20
half-measure to let incurably sick people steadily contaminate=20
the remaining healthy ones. This is in keeping with the humani-=20
tarianism which, to avoid hurting one individual, lets a hundred=20
others perish. The demand that defective people be prevented=20
from propagating equally defective offspring is a demand of the=20
clearest reason and if systematically executed represents the=20
most humane act of mankind. It will spare millions of unfortu=C2=AC=20
nates undeserved sufferings, and consequently will lead to a rising=20
improvement of health as a whole. The determination to proceed=20
in this direction will oppose a dam to the further spread of vene=C2=AC=20
real diseases. For, if necessary, the incurably sick will be pitilessly=20
segregated =E2=80=94 a barbaric measure for the unfortunate who is=20
struck by it, but a blessing for his fellow men and posterity. The=20
passing pain of a century can and will redeem millenniums from=20
sufferings.=20

The struggle against syphilis and the prostitution which pre-=20


256=20


Mein Kampf=20


pares the way for it is one of the most gigantic tasks of humanity,=20
gigantic because we are facing, not the solution of a single ques=C2=AC=20
tion, but the elimination of a large number of evils which bring=20
about this plague as a resultant manifestation. For in this case=20
the sickening of the body is only the consequence of a sickening of=20
the moral, social, and racial instincts.=20

But if out of smugness, or even cowardice, this battle is not=20
fought to its end, then take a look at the peoples five hundred=20
years from now. I think you will find but few images of God, un=C2=AC=20
less you want to profane the Almighty.=20

But how did they try to deal with this plague in old Germany?=20
Viewed calmly, the answer is really dismal. Assuredly, govern=C2=AC=20
ment circles well recognized the terrible evils, though perhaps=20
they were not quite able to ponder the consequences; but in the=20
struggle against it they failed totally, and instead of thorough=C2=AC=20
going reforms preferred to take pitiful measures. They tinkered=20
with the disease and left the causes untouched. They submitted=20
the individual prostitute to a medical examination, supervised=20
her as best they could, and, in case they established disease, put=20
her in some hospital from which after a superficial cure they again=20
let her loose on the rest of humanity.=20

To be sure, they had introduced a =E2=80=98protective paragraph 7 ac=C2=AC=
=20
cording to which anyone who was not entirely healthy or cured=20
must avoid sexual intercourse under penalty of the law. Surely=20
this measure is sound in itself, but in its practical application it=20
was almost a total failure. In the first place, the woman, in case=20
she is smitten by misfortune =E2=80=94 if only due to our, or rather her,=
=20
education =E2=80=94 will in most cases refuse to be dragged into court as=
=20
a witness against the wretched thief of her health =E2=80=94 often under=20
the most embarrassing attendant circumstances. She, in particu=C2=AC=20
lar, has little to gain from it; in most cases she will be the one to=20
suffer most =E2=80=94 for she will be struck much harder by the contempt=20
of her loveless fellow creatures than would be the case with a man.=20
Finally, imagine the situation if the conveyor of the disease is her=20
own husband. Should she accuse him? Or what else should she do?=20

In the case of the man, there is the additional fact that un-=20


Prostitution of the People=E2=80=99s Soul=20


257=20


fortunately he often runs across the path of this plague after=20
ample consumption of alcohol, since in this condition he is least=20
able to judge the qualities of his =E2=80=98fair one/ a fact which is only =
too=20
well known to the diseased prostitute, and always causes her to=20
angle after men in this ideal condition. And the upshot of it all=20
is that the man who gets an unpleasant surprise later can, even=20
by thoroughly racking his brains, not remember his kind bene=C2=AC=20
factress, which should not be surprising in a city like Berlin or=20
even Munich. In addition, it must be considered that often we=20
have to deal with visitors from the provinces who are completely=20
befuddled by all the magic of the big city.=20

Finally, however: who can know whether he is sick or healthy?=20
Are there not numerous cases in which a patient apparently cured=20
relapses and causes frightful mischief without himself suspecting=20
it at first?=20

Thus, the practical effect of this protection by legal punish=C2=AC=20
ment of a guilty infection is in reality practically nil. Exactly the=20
same is true of the supervision of prostitutes; and finally, the=20
cure itself, even today, is dubious. Only one thing is certain:=20
despite all measures the plague spread more and more, giving=20
striking confirmation of their ineffectualness.=20

The fight against the prostitution of the people=E2=80=99s soul was a=20
failure all along the line, or rather, that is, nothing at all was done.=20

Let anyone who is inclined to take this lightly just study the=20
basic statistical facts on the dissemination of this plague, compare=20
its growth in the last hundred years, and then imagine its further=20
development =E2=80=94 and he would really need the simplicity of an ass=20
to keep an unpleasant shudder from running down his back.=20

The weakness and half-heartedness of the position taken in old=20
Germany toward so terrible a phenomenon may be evaluated as=20
a visible sign of a people=E2=80=99s decay. If the power to fight for one=
=E2=80=99s own-=20
health is no longer present , the right to live in this world of struggle=
=20
ends. This world belongs only to the forceful =E2=80=98whole=E2=80=99 man a=
nd=20
not to the weak =E2=80=98half=E2=80=99 man.=20

One of the most obvious manifestations of decay in the old=20
Reich was the slow decline of the cultural level, and by culture I=20


258=20


Mein Kampf=20


do not mean what today is designated by the word =E2=80=98 civilization/=20
The latter, on the contrary, rather seems hostile to a truly high=20
standard of thinking and living.=20

Even before the turn of the century an element began to in=C2=AC=20
trude into our art which up to that time could be regarded as=20
entirely foreign and unknown. To be sure, even in earlier times=20
there were occasional aberrations of taste, but such cases were=20
rather artistic derailments, to which posterity could attribute at=20
least a certain historical value, than products no longer of an=20
artistic degeneration, but of a spiritual degeneration that had=20
reached the point of destroying the spirit. In them the political=20
collapse, which later became more visible, was culturally in=C2=AC=20
dicated.=20

Art Bolshevism is the only possible cultural form and spiritual=20
expression of Bolshevism as a whole.=20

Anyone to whom this seems strange need only subject the art=20
of the happily Bolshevized states to an examination, and, to his=20
horror, he will be confronted by the morbid excrescences of in=C2=AC=20
sane and degenerate men, with which, since the turn of the cen=C2=AC=20
tury, we have become familiar under the collective concepts of=20
cubism and dadaism, as the official and recognized art of those=20
states. Even in the short period of the Bavarian Republic of=20
Councils, this phenomenon appeared. Even here it could be=20
seen that all the official posters, propagandist drawings in the=20
newspapers, etc., bore the imprint, not only of political but of=20
cultural decay.=20

No more than a political collapse of the present magnitude=20
would have been conceivable sixty years ago was a cultural col=C2=AC=20
lapse such as began to manifest itself in futurist and cubist works=20
since 1900 thinkable. Sixty years ago an exhibition of so-called=20
dadaistic =E2=80=98 experiences =E2=80=99 would have seemed simply impossib=
le and=20
its organizers would have ended up in the madhouse, while today=20
they even preside over art associations. This plague could not=20
appear at that time, because neither would public opinion have=20
tolerated it nor the state calmly looked on. For it is the business=20
of the state, in other words, of its leaders, to prevent a people=20


Decline of the Theater=20


259=20


from being driven into the arms of spiritual madness. And this=20
is where such a development would some day inevitably end.=20
For on the day when this type of art really corresponded to the=20
general view of things, one of the gravest transformations of=20
humanity would have occurred: the regressive development of=20
the human mind would have begun and the end would be scarcely=20
conceivable.=20

Once we pass the development of our cultural life in the last=20
twenty-five years in review from this standpoint, we shall be hor=C2=AC=20
rified to see how far we are already engaged in this regression.=20
Everywhere we encounter seeds which represent the beginnings=20
of parasitic growths which must sooner or later be the ruin of=20
our culture. In them, too, we can recognize the symptoms of=20
decay of a slowly rotting world. Woe to the peoples who can no=20
longer master this disease!=20

Such diseases could be seen in Germany in nearly every field of=20
art and culture. Everything seemed to have passed the high=20
point and to be hastening toward the abyss. The theater was=20
sinking manifestly lower and even then would have disappeared=20
completely as a cultural factor if the Court Theaters at least had=20
not turned against the prostitution of art. If we disregard them=20
and a few other praiseworthy examples, the offerings of the stage=20
were of such a nature that it would have been more profitable for=20
the nation to keep away from them entirely. It was a sad sign of=20
inner decay that the youth could no longer be sent into most of=20
these so-called * abodes of art=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 a fact which was admitte=
d with=20
shameless frankness by a general display of the penny-arcade=20
warning: * Young people are not admitted V=20

Bear in mind that such precautionary measures had to be taken=20
in the places which should have existed primarily for the educa=C2=AC=20
tion of the youth and not for the delectation of old and jaded=20
sections of the population. What would the great dramatists of=20
all times have said to such a regulation, and what, above all, to the=20
circumstances which caused it? How Schiller would have flared=20
up, how Goethe would have turned away in indignation!=20

But after all, what are Schiller, Goethe, or Shakespeare com-=20


260=20


Mein Kampf=20


pared to the heroes of the newer German poetic art? Old, out=C2=AC=20
worn, outmoded, nay, obsolete. For that was the characteristic=20
thing about that period: not that the period itself produced=20
nothing but filth, but that in the bargain it befouled everything=20
that was. really great in the past. This, to be sure, is a phenome=C2=AC=20
non that can always be observed at such times. The baser and=20
more contemptible the products of the time and its people, the=20
more it hates the witnesses to the greater nobility and dignity of=20
a former day. In such times the people would best like to efface=20
the memory of mankind=E2=80=99s past completely, so that by excluding=20
every possibility of comparison they could pass off their own=20
trash as =E2=80=98art.=E2=80=99 Hence every new institution, the more wretc=
hed=20
and miserable it is, will try all the harder to extinguish the last=20
traces of the past time, whereas every true renascence of human=C2=AC=20
ity can start with an easy mind from the good achievements of=20
past generations; in fact, can often make them truly appreciated=20
for the first time. It does not have to fear that it will pale before=20
the past; no, of itself it contributes so valuable an addition to the=20
general store of human culture that often, in order to make this=20
culture fully appreciated, it strives to keep alive the memory of=20
former achievements, thus making sure that the present will fully=20
understand the new gift. Only those who can give nothing val=C2=AC=20
uable to the world, but try to act as if they were going to give it=20
God knows what, will hate everything that was previously given=20
and would best like to negate or even destroy it.=20

The truth of this is by no means limited to the field of general=20
culture, but applies to politics as well. Revolutionary new move=C2=AC=20
ments will hate the old forms in proportion to their own inferi=C2=AC=20
ority. Here, too, we can see how eagerness to make their own=20
trash appear to be something noteworthy leads to blind hatred=20
against the superior good of the past. As long, for example, as=20
the historical memory of Frederick the Great is not dead, Fried=C2=AC=20
rich Ebert can arouse nothing but limited amazement. The=20
hero of Sans-Souci is to the former Bremen saloon keeper 1 ap-=20

1 Before going into politics, Ebert was a saddle-maker. The source of=20
the legend about his being a tavern-keeper is that, as secretary of his tra=
de=20
union in Bremen, he helped to administer the union=E2=80=99s restaurant and=
 bar*=20


Spiritual Preparation for Bolshevism=20


261=20


proximately as the sun to the moon; only when the rays of the=20
sun die can the moon shine. Consequently, the hatred of all new=20
moons of humanity for the fixed stars is only too comprehensible.=20
In political life, such nonentities, if Fate temporarily casts power=20
in their lap, not only besmirch and befoul the past with untiring=20
zeal, but also remove themselves from general criticism by the=20
most extreme methods. The new German Reich=E2=80=99s legislation for=20
the defense of the Republic may pass as an example of this.=20

Therefore, if any new idea, a doctrine, a new philosophy, or=20
even a political or economic movement tries to deny the entire=20
past, tries to make it bad or worthless, for this reason alone we=20
must be extremely cautious and suspicious. As a rule the reason=20
for such hatred is either its own inferiority or even an evil inten=C2=AC=
=20
tion as such. A really beneficial renascence of humanity will=20
always have to continue building where the last good foundation=20
stops. It will not have to be ashamed of using already existing=20
truths. For the whole of human culture, as well as man himself,=20
is only the result of a single long development in which every=20
generation contributed and fitted in its stone. Thus the meaning=20
and purpose of revolutions is not to tear down the whole building,=20
but to remove what is bad or unsuitable and to continue building=20
on the sound spot that has been laid bare.=20

Thus alone can we and may we speak of the progress of hu=C2=AC=20
manity. Otherwise the world would never be redeemed from=20
chaos, since every generation would be entitled to reject the past=20
and hence destroy the works of the past as the presupposition for=20
its own work.=20

Thus, the saddest thing about the state of our whole culture of=20
the pre-War period was not only the total impotence of artistic=20
and cultural creative power in general, but the hatred with=20
which the memory of the greater past was besmirched and ef=C2=AC=20
faced. In nearly all fields of art, especially in the theater and=20
literature, we began around the turn of the century to produce=20
less that was new and significant, but to disparage the best of the=20
old work and represent it as inferior and surpassed; as though this=20
epoch of the most humiliating inferiority could surpass anything=20


262=20


Mein Kampf=20


at all. And from this effort to remove the past from the eyes of=20
the present, the evil intent of the apostles of the future could=20
clearly and distinctly be seen. By this it should have been rec=C2=AC=20
ognized that these were no new, even if false, cultural conceptions,=20
but a process of destroying all culture, paving the way for a=20
stultification of healthy artistic feeling: the spiritual preparation=20
of political Bolshevism. For if the age of Pericles seems embodied=20
in the Parthenon, the Bolshevistic present is embodied in a cubist=20
monstrosity.=20

In this connection we must also point to the cowardice which=20
here again was manifest in the section of our people which on the=20
basis of its education and position should have been obligated=20
to resist this cultural disgrace. But from pure fear of the clamor=20
raised by the apostles of Bolshevistic art, who furiously attacked=20
anyone who didn=E2=80=99t want to recognize the crown of creation in=20
them and pilloried him as a backward philistine, they renounced=20
all serious resistance and reconciled themselves to what seemed=20
after all inevitable. They were positively scared stiff that these=20
half-wits or scoundrels would accuse them of lack of understand=C2=AC=20
ing; as though it were a disgrace not to understand the products=20
of spiritual degenerates or slimy swindlers. These cultural dis=C2=AC=20
ciples, it is true;, possessed a very simple means of passing off their=20
nonsense as something God knows how important: they passed=20
off all sorts of incomprehensible and obviously crazy stuff on=20
their amazed fellow men as a so-called inner experience, a cheap=20
way of taking any word of opposition out of the mouths of most=20
people in advance. For beyond a doubt this could be an inner=20
experience; the doubtful part was whether it is permissible to=20
dish up the hallucinations of lunatics or criminals to the healthy=20
world. The works of a Moritz von Schwind, or of a Bocklin, were=20
also an inner experience, but of artists graced by God and not of=20
clowns.=20

Here was a good occasion to study the pitiful cowardice of our=20
so-called intelligentsia, which dodged any serious resistance to=20
this poisoning of the healthy instinct of our people and left it to=20
the people themselves to deal with this insolent nonsense. In=20


Heaps of Humanity=20


263=20


order not to be considered lacking in artistic understanding, peo=C2=AC=20
ple stood for every mockery of art and ended up by becoming=20
really uncertain in the judgment of good and bad.=20

All in all, these were tokens of times that were getting very bad.=20


# # #=20


As another disquieting attribute, the following must yet be=20
stated:=20

In the nineteenth century our cities began more and more to=20
lose the character of cultural sites and to descend to the level of=20
mere human settlements. The small attachment of our present=20
big-city proletariat for the town they live in is the consequence of=20
the fact that it is only the individual's accidental local stopping=20
place, and nothing more. This is partly connected with the fre=C2=AC=20
quent change of residence caused by social conditions, which do=20
not give a man time to form a closer bond with the city, and an=C2=AC=20
other cause is to be found in the general cultural insignificance=20
and poverty of our present-day cities per se .=20

At the time of the wars of liberation, the German cities were=20
not only small in number, but also modest as to size. The few=20
really big cities were mostly princely residences, and as such=20
nearly always possessed a certain cultural value and for the most=20
part also a certain artistic picture. The few places with more than=20
fifty thousand inhabitants were, compared to present-day cities=20
with the same population, rich in scientific and artistic treasures.=20
When Munich numbered sixty thousand souls, it was already=20
on its way to becoming one of the first German art centers; today=20
nearly every factory town has reached this number, if not many=20
times surpassed it, yet some cannot lay claim to the slightest real=20
values. Masses of apartments and tenements, and nothing more.=20
How, in view of such emptiness, any special bond could be ex=C2=AC=20
pected to arise with such a town must remain a mystery. No one=20
will be particularly attached to a city which has nothing more to=20
offer than every other, which lacks every individual note and in=20


264=20


Mein Kampf=20


which everything has been carefully avoided which might even=20
look like art or anything of the sort.=20

But, as if this were not enough, even the really big cities grow=20
relatively poorer in real art treasures with the mounting increase=20
in the population. They seem more and more standardized and=20
give entirely the same picture as the poor little factory towns,=20
though in larger dimensions. What recent times have added to=20
the cultural content of our big cities is totally inadequate. All=20
our cities are living on the fame and treasures of the past. For=20
instance, take from present-day Munich everything that was=20
created under Ludwig I, 1 and you will note with horror how poor=20
the addition of significant artistic creations has been since that=20
time. The same is true of Berlin and most other big cities.=20

The essential point, however, is the following: our big cities of=20
today possess no monuments dominating the city picture, which=20
might somehow be regarded as the symbols of the whole epoch.=20
This was true in the cities of antiquity, since nearly every one=20
possessed a special monument in which it took pride. The char=C2=AC=20
acteristic aspect of the ancient city did not lie in private buildings,=20
but in the community monuments which seemed made, not for=20
the moment, but for eternity, because they were intended to re=C2=AC=20
flect, not the wealth of an individual owner, but the greatness and=20
wealth of the community. Thus arose monuments which were=20
very well suited to unite the individual inhabitant with his city in=20
a way which today sometimes seems almost incomprehensible to=20
us. For what the ancient had before his eyes was less the humble=20
houses of private owners than the magnificent edifices of the=20
whole community. Compared to them the dwelling house really=20
sank to the level of an insignificant object of secondary impor=C2=AC=20
tance.=20

1 Ludwig I, King of Bavaria from 1825 to 1848. Hitler apparently over=C2=AC=
=20
looks the fact that from 1806 to 1809 he fought on the side of Napoleon=20
against Austria and Prussia. Ludwig was a man of scholarly and artistic=20
leanings; he made Munich a home of the arts. He was an enthusiast for=20
Greek independence, and his son Otto became the first King of independent=
=20
Greece.=20


Department Store and Hotel=20


265=20


Only if we compare the dimensions of the ancient state struc=C2=AC=20
tures with contemporary dwelling houses can we understand the=20
overpowering sweep and force of this emphasis on the princi=C2=AC=20
ple of giving first place to public works. The few still towering=20
colossuses which we admire in the ruins and wreckage of the=20
ancient world are not former business palaces, but temples and=20
state structures; in other words, works whose owner was the=20
community. Even in the splendor of late Rome the first place=20
was not taken by the villas and palaces of individual citizens, but=20
by the temples and baths, the stadiums, circuses, aqueducts,=20
basilicas, etc., of the state, hence of the whole people.=20

Even the Germanic Middle Ages upheld the same guiding=20
principle, though amid totally different conceptions of art. What=20
in antiquity found its expression in the Acropolis or the Pantheon=20
now cloaked itself in the forms of the Gothic Cathedral. Like=20
giants these monumental structures towered over the swarming=20
frame, wooden, and brick buildings of the medieval city, and thus=20
became symbols which even today, with the tenements climbing=20
higher and higher beside them, determine the character and pic=C2=AC=20
ture of these towns. Cathedrals, town halls, grain markets, and=20
battlements are the visible signs of a conception which in the last=20
analysis was the same as that of antiquity.=20

Yet how truly deplorable the relation between state buildings=20
and private buildings has become today! If the fate of Rome=20
should strike Berlin, future generations would some day admire=20
the department stores of a few Jews as the mightiest works of our=20
era and the hotels of a few corporations as the characteristic ex=C2=AC=20
pression of the culture of our times. Just compare the miserable=20
discrepancy prevailing in a city like even Berlin between the=20
structures of the Reich and those of finance and commerce.=20

Even the sum of money spent on state buildings is usually=20
laughable and inadequate. Works are not built for eternity, but=20
at most for the need of the moment. And in them there is no=20
dominant higher idea. At the time of its construction, the Berlin=20
Schloss was a work of different stature than the new library, for=20
instance, in the setting of the present time. While a single battle-=20


266=20


Mein Kampf=20


ship represented a value of approximately sixty millions, hardly=20
half of this sum was approved for the first magnificent building=20
of the Reich, intended to stand for eternity, the Reichstag Build=C2=AC=20
ing. Indeed, when the question of interior furnishings came up=20
for decision, the exalted house voted against the use of stone and=20
ordered the walls trimmed with plaster; this time, I must admit,=20
the parliamentarians did right for a change: stone walls are no=20
place for plaster heads.=20

Thus, our cities of the present lack the outstanding symbol of=20
national community which, we must therefore not be surprised to=20
find, sees no symbol of itself in the cities. The inevitable result=20
is a desolation whose practical effect is the total indifference of=20
the big-city dweller to the destiny of his city.=20

This, too, is a sign of our declining culture and our general col=C2=AC=20
lapse. The epoch is stifling in the pettiest utilitarianism or better=20
expressed in the service of money. And we have no call for sur=C2=AC=20
prise if under such a deity little sense of heroism remains. The=20
present time is only harvesting what the immediate past has=20
sown.=20


=E2=80=A2Jr 7P vv*=20

All these symptoms of decay are in the last analysis only the=20
consequences of the absence of a definite, uniformly acknowledged=20
philosophy and the resultant general uncertainty in the judgment=20
and attitude toward the various great problems of the time.=20
That is why, beginning in education, everyone is half-hearted=20
and vacillating, shunning responsibility and thus ending in=20
cowardly tolerance of even recognized abuses. Humanitarian=20
bilge becomes stylish and, by weakly yielding to cankers and=20
sparing individuals, the future of millions is sacrificed.=20

How widespread the general disunity was growing is shown by=20
an examination of religious conditions before the War. Here,=20
too, a unified and effective philosophical conviction had long since=20
been lost in large sections of the nation. In this the members=20


Religious Conditions=20


267=20


officially breaking away from the churches play a less important=20
role than those who are completely indifferent. While both de=C2=AC=20
nominations maintain missions in Asia and Africa in order to win=20
new followers for their doctrine =E2=80=94 an activity which can boast=20
but very modest success compared to the advance of the Moham=C2=AC=20
medan faith in particular =E2=80=94 right here in Europe they lose mil=C2=
=AC=20
lions and millions of inward adherents who either are alien to all=20
religious life or simply go their own ways. The consequences,=20
particularly from the moral point of view, are not favorable.=20

Also noteworthy is the increasingly violent struggle against=20
the dogmatic foundations of the various churches without which=20
in this human world the practical existence of a religious faith is=20
not conceivable. The great masses of people do not consist of=20
philosophers; precisely for the masses, faith is often the sole=20
foundation of a moral attitude. The various substitutes have not=20
proved so successful from the standpoint of results that they could=20
be regarded as a useful replacement for previous religious creeds.=20
But if religious doctrine and faith are really to embrace the broad=20
masses, the unconditional authority of the content of this faith=20
is the foundation of all efficacy. What the current mores ,=20
without which assuredly hundreds of thousands of well-bred=20
people would live sensibly and reasonably but millions of others=20
would not, are for general living, state principles are for the state,=20
and dogmas for the current religion. Only through them is the=20
wavering and infinitely interpretable, purely intellectual idea=20
delimited and brought into a form without which it could never=20
become faith. Otherwise the idea would never pass beyond a=20
metaphysical conception; in short, a philosophical opinion. The=20
attack against dogmas as such, therefore, strongly resembles the=20
struggle against the general legal foundations of a state, and, as=20
the latter would end in a total anarchy of the state, the former=20
would end in a worthless religious nihilism.=20

For the political man, the value of a religion must be estimated=20
less by its deficiencies than by the virtue of a visibly better sub=C2=AC=
=20
stitute. As long as this appears to be lacking, what is present can=20
be demolished only by fools or criminals.=20


268=20


Mein Kampf=20


Not the smallest blame for the none too delectable religious=20
conditions must be borne by those who encumber the religious=20
idea with too many things of a purely earthly nature and thus=20
often bring it into a totally unnecessary conflict with so-called=20
exact science. In this victory will almost always fall to the latter,=20
though perhaps after a hard struggle, and religion will suffer=20
serious damage in the eyes of all those who are unable to raise=20
themselves above a purely superficial knowledge.=20

Worst of all, however, is the devastation wrought by the misuse=20
of religious conviction for political ends. In truth, we cannot=20
sharply enough attack those wretched crooks who would like to=20
make religion an implement to perform political or rather business=20
services for them. These insolent liars, it is true, proclaim their=20
creed in a stentorian voice to the whole world for other sinners to=20
hear; but their intention is not, if necessary, to die for it, but to=20
live better. For a single political swindle, provided it brings in=20
enough, they are willing to sell the heart of a whole religion; for=20
ten parliamentary mandates they would ally themselves with=20
the Marxistic mortal enemies of all religions =E2=80=94 and for a minister=
=E2=80=99s=20
chair they would even enter into marriage with the devil, unless=20
the devil were deterred by a remnant of decency.=20

If in Germany before the War religious life for many had an=20
unpleasant aftertaste, this could be attributed to the abuse of=20
Christianity on the part of a so-called 1 Christian =E2=80=99 party and the=
=20
shameless way in which they attempted to identify the Catholic=20
faith with a political party.=20

This false association was a calamity which may have brought=20
parliamentary mandates to a number of good-for-nothings but=20
injury to the Church.=20

The consequence, however, had to be borne by the whole na=C2=AC=20
tion, since the outcome of the resultant slackening of religious life=20
occurred at a time when everyone was beginning to waver and=20
vacillate anyway, and the traditional foundations of ethics and=20
morality were threatening to collapse.=20

This, too, created cracks and rifts in our nation which might=20
present no danger as long as no special strain arose, but which=20


Aimlessness of German Policy=20


269=20


inevitably became catastrophic when by the force of great events=20
the question of the inner solidity of the nation achieved decisive=20
importance.=20

=E2=96=A07T IT=20

Likewise in the field of politics the observant eye could discern=20
evils which, if not remedied or altered within a reasonable time,=20
could be and had to be regarded as signs of the Reich=E2=80=99s coming=20
decay. The aimlessness of German domestic and foreign policy=20
was apparent to everyone who was not purposely blind. The=20
regime of compromise seemed to be most in keeping with Bis=C2=AC=20
marck=E2=80=99s conception that 1 politics is an art of the possible.=E2=80=
=99 But=20
between Bismarck and the later German chancellors there was=20
a slight difference which made it permissible for the former to=20
let fall such an utterance on the nature of politics while the same=20
view from the mouths of his successors could not but take on an=20
entirely different meaning. For Bismarck with this phrase only=20
wanted to say that for the achievement of a definite political=20
goal all possibilities should be utilized, or, in other words, that=20
all possibilities should be taken into account; in the view of his=20
successors, however, this utterance solemnly released them from=20
the necessity of having any political ideas or goals whatever.=20
And the leadership of the Reich at this time really had no more=20
political goals; for the necessary foundation of a definite philos=C2=AC=20
ophy was lacking, as well as the necessary clarity on the inner=20
laws governing the development of all political life.=20

There were not a few who saw things blackly in this respect=20
and flayed the planlessness and heedlessness of the Reich=E2=80=99s poli=C2=
=AC=20
cies, and well recognized their inner weakness and hollowness,=20
but these were only outsiders in political life; the official govern=C2=AC=

studied in Geneva. Went to Germany in 1885 and remained there until his=20
death. He became a staunch German patriot and pan-German, a close=20
friend of William II. In 1908, he married Eva Wagner, Richard=E2=80=99s dau=

These people are too stupid to think anything for themselves=20
and too conceited to learn what is necessary from others =E2=80=94 an=20
age-old truth which caused Oxenstierna to cry out: =E2=80=98The world=20
is governed by a mere fraction of wisdom =E2=80=99; 1 and indeed nearly=20
every ministerial secretary embodies only an atom of this frac=C2=AC=20
tion. Only since Germany has become a republic, this no longer=20
applies. That is why it has been forbidden by the Law for the=20
Defense of the Republic 2 to believe, let alone discuss, any such=20
thought. Oxenstierna was lucky to live when he did, and not=20
in this wise republic of ours.=20

Even in the pre-War period that institution which was sup=C2=AC=20
posed to embody the strength of the Reich was recognized by=20
many as its greatest weakness: the parliament or Reichstag.=20
Cowardice and irresponsibility were here completely wedded.=20

One of the foolish remarks which today we not infrequently=20
hear is that parliamentarism in Germany has =E2=80=98gone wrong since=20
the revolution/ This too easily gives the impression that it was=20

zehnten J ahrhunderts (.Foundations of the Nineteenth Century). Shortly bef=
ore=20
his death he met Hitler, by whom he was greatly impressed. Many of Hitler=
=E2=80=99s=20
ideas seem to originate in Chamberlain. Alfred Rosenberg is said to have=20
prepared excerpts from Chamberlain=E2=80=99s ponderous work for Der Fiihrer=
 to=20
read.=20

1 The usual version of this saying is, =E2=80=98Weisst du nicht mein Sohn m=
il wie=20
wenig Verstand die Welt regiert wird? =E2=80=99 (Do you not know, my son, w=
ith how=20
little understanding the world is governed?) Hitler=E2=80=99s cryptic formu=
lation=20
seems to be his own. The saying has been attributed to Pope Julius III=20
(1550-1555) and to Axel Oxenstierna (1583-1654), prime minister to=20
Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. It does not occur in any of Oxenstiema=E2=80=
=99s=20
works, but was attributed to him by Johann Arkenholtz, an eighteenth-=20
century writer, in his Schwedische Merkwilrdigkeiten (Swedish Curiosities )=
.=20
It has also been attributed to various other people. The phrase apparently=

Parliamentary Half Measures=20


271=20


different before the revolution. In reality the effect of this insti=C2=AC=
=20
tution can be nothing else than devastating =E2=80=94 and this was true=20
even in those days when most people wore blinders and saw=20
nothing and wanted to see nothing. For if Germany was crushed,=20
it was owing not least to this institution; no thanks are owing=20
to the Reichstag that the catastrophe did not occur earlier;=20
this must be attributed to the resistance to the activity of this=20
gravedigger of the German nation and the German Reich, which=20
persisted in the years of peace.=20

Out of the vast number of devastating evils for which this=20
institution was directly or indirectly responsible, I shall pick=20
only a single one which is most in keeping with the inner essence=20
of this most irresponsible institution of all times: the terrible=20
half-heartedness and weakness of the political leaders of the=20
Reich both at home and abroad, which, primarily attributable to=20
the activities of the Reichstag, developed into one of the chief=20
reasons for the political collapse.=20

Half-hearted was everything that was subject in any way to=20
the influence of this parliament, regardless which way you look.=20

Half-hearted and weak was the alliance policy of the Reich=20
in its foreign relations. By trying to preserve peace it steered=20
inevitably toward war.=20

Half-hearted was the Polish policy. It consisted in irritating=20
without ever seriously going through with anything. The result=20
was neither a victory for the Germans nor conciliation of the=20
Poles, but hostility with Russia instead.=20

Half-hearted was the solution of the Alsace-Lorraine question.=20
Instead of crushing the head of the French hydra once and for=20
all with a brutal fist, and then granting the Alsatian equal rights,=20
neither of the two was done. Nor could it be, for in the ranks=20
of the biggest parties sat the biggest traitors =E2=80=94 in the Center,=20
for example, Herr Wetterle. 1=20

1 Emile Wetterle, Alsatian Catholic politician. From 1898 to 1914 he=20
belonged to the Reichstag, and in 1910 he founded the Alsatian Nationalist=
=20
Party. Bitterly hostile to Germany, he fled to France in 1914. In 1919 he=
=20
became a French deputy. His books include Les Coulisses du Reichstag=20
(1918) and L\Alsace et La, Guerre (1919),=20


272=20


Mein Kampf=20


All this, however, would have been bearable if the general=20
half-heartedness had not taken possession of that power on whose=20
existence the survival of the Reich ultimately depended: the=20
army.=20

The sins of the so-called =E2=80=98German Reichstag=E2=80=99 would alone=20
suffice to cover it for all times with the curse of the German=20
nation. For the most miserable reasons, these parliamentary=20
rabble stole and struck from the hand of the nation its weapon=20
of self-preservation, the only defense of our people=E2=80=99s freedom and=
=20
independence. If today the graves of Flanders field were to=20
open, from them would arise the bloody accusers, hundreds of=20
thousands of the best young Germans who, due to the unscrupu=C2=AC=20
lousness of these parliamentarian criminals, were driven, poorly=20
trained and half-trained, into the arms of death; the-fatherland=20
lost them and millions of crippled and dead, solely and alone so=20
that a few hundred misleaders of the people could perpetrate=20
their political swindles and blackmail, or merely rattle off their=20
doctrinaire theories.=20

While the Jews in their Marxist and democratic press pro=C2=AC=20
claimed to the whole world the lie about =E2=80=98German militarism=E2=80=
=99=20
and sought to incriminate Germany by all means, the Marxist=20
and democratic parties were obstructing any comprehensive=20
training of the German national man-power. The enormous=20
crime that was thus committed could not help but be clear to=20
everyone who just considered that, in case of a coming war, the=20
entire nation would have to take up arms, and that, therefore,=20
through the rascality of these savory representatives of their=20
own so-called =E2=80=98popular representation,=E2=80=99 millions of Germans=
 were=20
driven to face the enemy half-trained and badly trained. But=20
even if the consequences resulting from the brutal and savage=20
unscrupulousness of these parliamentary pimps were left entirely=20
out of consideration: this lack of trained soldiers at the begin=C2=AC=20
ning of the War could easily lead to its loss, and this was most=20
terribly confirmed in the great World War.=20

The loss of the fight for the freedom and independence of the=20
German nation is the result of the half-heartedness and weakness=20


Erroneous Naval Policy=20


273=20


manifested even in peacetime as regards drafting the entire=20
national man-power for the defense of the fatherland.=20

* # #=20

If too few recruits were trained on the land, the same half=C2=AC=20
heartedness was at work on the sea, making the weapon of=20
national self-preservation more or less worthless. Unfortunately,=20
the navy leadership was itself infected with the spirit of half=C2=AC=20
heartedness. The tendency to build all ships a little smaller than=20
the English ships which were being launched at the same time=20
was hardly farsighted, much less brilliant. Especially a fleet=20
which from the beginning can in point of pure numbers not be=20
brought to the same level as its presumable adversary must seek=20
to compensate for the lack of numbers by the superior fighting=20
power of its individual ships. It is the superior fighting power=20
which matters and not any legendary superiority in =E2=80=98quality/=20
Actually modern technology is so far advanced and has achieved=20
so much uniformity in the various civilized countries that it=20
must be held impossible to give the ships of one power an appreci=C2=AC=20
ably larger combat value than the ships of like tonnage of an=C2=AC=20
other state. And it is even less conceivable to achieve a superi=C2=AC=20
ority with smaller deplacement as compared to larger.=20

In actual fact, the smaller tonnage of the German ships was=20
possible only at the cost of speed and armament. The phrase=20
with which people attempted to justify this fact showed a very=20
serious lack of logic in the department responsible for this in=20
peacetime. They declared, for instance, that the material of the=20
German guns was so obviously superior to the British that the=20
German 28-centimeter gun was not behind the British 30.5-=20
centimeter gun in performance!!=20

But for this very reason it would have been our duty to change=20
over to the 30.5-centimeter gun, for the goal should have been=20
the achievement, not of equal but of superior fighting power.=20
Otherwise it would have been superfluous for the army to order=20


274=20


Mein Kampf=20


the 42-cenumeter mortar, since the German 21-centimeter mortar=20
was in itself superior to any then existing high trajectory French=20
cannon, and the fortresses would have likewise fallen to the=20
30.5-centimeter mortar. The leadership of the land army, how=C2=AC=20
ever, thought soundly, while that of the navy unfortunately=20
did not.=20

The neglect of superior artillery power and superior speed lay=20
entirely in the absolutely erroneous so-called =E2=80=98idea of risk/ The=
=20
navy leadership by the very form in which it expanded the fleet=20
renounced attack and thus from the outset inevitably assumed=20
the defensive. But in this they also renounced the ultimate suc=C2=AC=20
cess which is and can only be forever in attack.=20

A ship of smaller speed and weaker armament will as a rule be=20
sent to the bottom by a speedier and more heavily armed enemy=20
at the firing distance favorable for the latter. A number of our=20
cruisers were to find this out to their bitter grief. The utter=20
mistakenness of the peacetime opinion of the navy staff was=20
shown by the War, which forced the introduction, whenever=20
possible, of modified armament in old ships and better armament=20
in newer ones. If in the battle of Skagerrak the German ships=20
had had the tonnage, the armament, the same speed as the=20
English ships, the British navy would have found a watery grave=20
beneath the hurricane of the more accurate and more effective=20
German 38-centimeter shells.=20

Japan carried on a different naval policy in those days. There,=20
on principle, the entire emphasis was laid on giving every single=20
new ship superior fighting power over the presumable adversary.=20
The result was a greater possibility of offensive utilization of the=20
navy.=20

While the staff of the land army still kept free of such basically=20
false trains of thought, the navy, which unfortunately had better=20
=E2=80=98 parliamentary =E2=80=99 representation, succumbed to the spirit o=
f parlia=C2=AC=20
ment. It was organized on the basis of half-baked ideas and was=20
later used in a similar way. What immortal fame the navy never=C2=AC=20
theless achieved could only be set to the account of the skill of=20
the German armaments worker and the ability and incomparable=20


German Advantages=20


275=20




heroism of the individual officers and crews. If the previous naval=20
high command had shown corresponding intelligence, these sac=C2=AC=20
rifices would not have been in vain.=20

Thus perhaps it was precisely the superior parliamentary dex=C2=AC=20
terity of the navy=E2=80=99s peacetime head that resulted in its misfor=C2=
=AC=20
tune, since, even in its building, parliamentary instead of purely=20
military criteria unfortunately began to play the decisive role.=20
The half-heartedness and weakness as well as the meager logic=20
in thinking, 1 characteristic of the parliamentary institution,=20
began to color the leadership of the navy.=20

The land army, as already emphasized, still refrained from=20
such basically false trains of thought. Particularly the colonel=20
in the great General Staff of that time, Ludendorff, carried on a=20
desperate struggle against the criminal half-heartedness and=20
weakness with which the Reichstag approached the vital prob=C2=AC=20
lems of the nation, and for the most part negated them. If the=20
struggle which this officer then carried on was nevertheless in=20
vain, the blame was borne half by parliament and half by the=20
attitude and weakness =E2=80=94 even more miserable, if possible =E2=80=94=
=20
of Reich Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg. Yet today this does=20
not in the least prevent those who were responsible for the=20
German collapse from putting the blame precisely on him who=20
alone combated this neglect of national interests =E2=80=94 one swindle=20
more or less is nothing to these born crooks.=20

Anyone who contemplates all the sacrifices which were heaped=20
on the nation by the criminal frivolity of these most irre=C2=AC=20

uselessly sacrificed dead and maimed, as well as the boundless=20

that these creatures can, believe me, be described only by words=20

Strangely enough, all the really seamy sides of old Germany=20
attracted attention only when the inner solidarity of the nation=20
would inevitably suffer thereby. Yes, indeed, in such cases the=20
unpleasant truths were positively bellowed to the broad masses,=20
while otherwise the same people preferred modestly to conceal=20
many things and in part simply to deny them. This was the case=20
when the open discussion of a question might have led to an im=C2=AC=20
provement. At the same time, the government offices in charge=20
knew next to nothing of the value and nature of propaganda.=20
The fact that by clever and persevering use of propaganda even=20
heaven can be represented as hell to the people, and conversely=20
the most wretched life as paradise, was known only to the Jew,=20
who acted accordingly; the German, or rather his government,=20
hadn=E2=80=99t the faintest idea of this.=20

During the War we were to suffer most gravely for all this.=20

Along with all the evils of German life before the War here=20
indicated, and many more, there were also many advantages.=20
In a fair examination, we must even recognize that most of our=20
weaknesses were largely shared by other countries and peoples,=20
and in some, indeed, we were put completely in the shade, while=20
they did not possess many of our own actual advantages.=20

At the head of these advantages we can, among other things,=20
set the fact that, of nearly all European peoples, the German=20
people still made the greatest attempt to preserve the national=20
character of its economy and despite certain evil omens was least=20
subject to international financial control. A dangerous advan-=20


Psychological Errors of the Old Regime 277=20

tage, to be sure, which later became the greatest instigator of the=20
World War. But aside from this and many other things, we=20
must, from the vast number of healthy sources of national=20
strength, pick three institutions which in their kind were ex=C2=AC=20
emplary and in part unequaled.=20

First, the state form as such and the special stamp which it=20
had received in modern Germany.=20

Here we may really disregard the individual monarchs who as=20
men are subject to all the weaknesses which are customarily=20
visited upon this earth and its children; if we were not lenient in=20
this, we would have to despair of the present altogether, for are=20
not the representatives of the present regime, considered as per=C2=AC=20
sonalities, intellectually and morally of the most modest propor=C2=AC=20
tions that we can conceive of even racking our brains for a long=20
time? Anyone who measures the =E2=80=98 value 9 of the German revolu=C2=AC=
=20
tion by the value and stature of the personalities which it has=20
given the German people since November, 1919, will have to=20
hide his head for shame before the judgment of future genera=C2=AC=20
tions, whose tongue it will no longer be possible to stop by pro=C2=AC=20
tective laws, etc., and which therefore will say what today all of=20
us know to be true, to wit, that brains and virtue in our modern=20
German leaders are inversely proportionate to their vices and=20
the size of their mouths.=20

To be sure, the monarchy had grown alien to many, to the=20
broad masses above all. This was the consequence of the fact=20
that the monarchs were not always surrounded by the brightest=20
=E2=80=94 to put it mildly =E2=80=94 and above all not by the sincerest min=
ds.=20
Unfortunately, a number of them liked flatterers better than=20
straightforward natures, and consequently it was the flatterers=20
who 1 instructed=E2=80=99 them. A very grave evil at a time when many=20
of the world=E2=80=99s old opinions had undergone a great change, spread=C2=
=AC=20
ing naturally to the estimation in which many old-established=20
traditions of the courts were held.=20

Thus, at the turn of the century the common man in the street=20
could no longer find any special admiration for the princess who=20
rode along the front in uniform. Apparently those in authority=20


278=20


Mein Kampf=20


were incapable of correctly judging the effect of such a parade in=20
the eyes of the people, for if they had, such unfortunate perform=C2=AC=20
ances would doubtless not have occurred. Moreover, the humani=C2=AC=20
tarian bilge =E2=80=94 not always entirely sincere =E2=80=94 that these cir=
cles=20
went in for repelled more than it attracted. If, for example,=20
Princess X condescended to taste a sample of food in a people=E2=80=99s=20
kitchen, in former days it might have looked well, but now the=20
result was the opposite. We may be justified in assuming that=20
Her Highness really had no idea that the food on the day she=20
sampled it was a little different from what it usually was; but it=20
was quite enough that the people knew it.=20

Thus, what may possibly have been the best intention became=20
ridiculous, if not actually irritating.=20

Stories about the monarch=E2=80=99s proverbial frugality, his much too=20
early rising and his slaving away until late into the night, amid=20
the permanent peril of threatening undernourishment, aroused=20
very dubious comments. People did not ask to know what food=20
and how much of it the monarch deigned to consume; they did=20
not begrudge him a =E2=80=98square=E2=80=99 meal; nor were they out to de=
=C2=AC=20
prive him of the sleep he needed; they were satisfied if in other=20
things, as a man and character, he was an honor to the name of=20
his house and to the nation, and if he fulfilled his duties as a ruler.=20
Telling fairy tales helped little, but did all the more harm.=20

This and many similar things were mere trifles, however.=20
What had a worse effect on sections of the nation, that were un=C2=AC=20
fortunately very large, was the mounting conviction that people=20
were ruled from the top no matter what happened, and that,=20
therefore, the individual had no need to bother about anything.=20
As long as the government was really good, or at least had the=20
best intentions, this was bearable. But woe betide if the old=20
government whose intentions were after all good were replaced=20
by a new one which was not so decent; then spineless compliance=20
and childlike faith were the gravest calamity that could be con=C2=AC=20
ceived of.=20

But along with these and many other weaknesses, there were=20
unquestionable assets.=20


The Army =E2=80=94 An Irreplaceable School=20


279=20


For one thing, the stability of the entire state leadership,=20
brought about by the monarchic form of state and the removal=20
of the highest state posts from the welter of speculation by am=C2=AC=20
bitious politicians. Furthermore, the dignity of the institution as=20
such and the authority which this alone created: likewise the rais=C2=AC=20
ing of the civil service and particularly the army above the level=20
of party obligations. One more advantage was the personal em=C2=AC=20
bodiment of the state=E2=80=99s summit in the monarch as a person, and=20
the example of responsibility which is bound to be stronger in a=20
monarch than in the accidental rabble of a parliamentary ma=C2=AC=20
jority =E2=80=94 the proverbial incorruptibility of the German adminis=C2=
=AC=20
tration could primarily be attributed to this. Finally, the cultu=C2=AC=20
ral value of the monarchy for the German people was high and=20
could very well compensate for other drawbacks. The German=20
court cities were still the refuge of an artistic state of mind,=20
which is increasingly threatening to die out in our materialistic=20
times. What the German princes did for art and science, par=C2=AC=20
ticularly in the nineteenth century, was exemplary. The present=20
period in any case cannot be compared with it.=20


# # #=20


As the greatest credit factor, however, in this period of incipi=C2=AC=20
ent and slowly spreading decomposition of our nation, we must=20
note the army. It was the mightiest school of the German nation,=20
and not for nothing was the hatred of all our enemies directed=20
against this buttress of national freedom and independence. No=20
more glorious monument can be dedicated to this unique institu=C2=AC=20
tion than a statement of the truth that it was slandered, hated,=20
combated, and also feared by all inferior peoples. The fact that=20
the rage of the international exploiters of our people in Versailles=20
was directed primarily against the old German army permits=20
us to recognize it as the bastion of our national freedom against=20
the power of the stock exchange. Without this warning power,=20
the intentions of Versailles would long since have been carried out=20


280=20


Mein Kampf=20


against our people. What the German people owes to the army=20
can be briefly summed up in a single word, to wit: everything.=20

The army trained men for unconditional responsibility at a=20
time when this quality had grown rare and evasion of it was be=C2=AC=20
coming more and more the order of the day, starting with the=20
model prototype of all irresponsibility, the parliament; it trained=20
men in personal courage in an age when cowardice threatened=20
to become a raging disease and the spirit of sacrifice, the willing=C2=AC=
=20
ness to give oneself for the general welfare, was looked on almost=20
as stupidity, and the only man regarded as intelligent was the=20
one who best knew how to indulge and advance his own ego; it=20
was the school that still taught the individual German not to=20
seek the salvation of the nation in lying phrases about an inter=C2=AC=20
national brotherhood between Negroes, Germans, Chinese,=20
French, etc., but in the force and solidarity of our own nation.=20

The army trained men in resolution while elsewhere in life=20
indecision and doubt were beginning to determine the actions=20
of men. In an age when everywhere the know-it-alls were setting=20
the tone, it meant something to uphold the principle that some=20
command is always better than none. In this sole principle there=20
was still an unspoiled robust health which would long since have=20
disappeared from the rest of our life if the army and its training=20
had not provided a continuous renewal of this primal force.=20
We need only see the terrible indecision of the Reich=E2=80=99s present=20
leaders, who can summon up the energy for no action unless it=20
is the forced signing of a new decree for plundering the people;=20
in this case, to be sure, they reject all responsibility and with the=20
agility of a court stenographer sign everything that anyone may=20
see fit to put before them. In this case the decision is easy to=20
take; for it is dictated.=20

The army trained men in idealism and devotion to the father-=20
land and its greatness while everywhere else greed and material=C2=AC=20
ism had spread abroad. It educated a single people in contrast=20
to the division into classes and in this perhaps its sole mistake=20
was the institution of voluntary one-year enlistment. A mis=C2=AC=20
take, because through it the principle of unconditional equality=20


The Incomparable Civil Service=20


281=20


was broken, and the man with higher education was removed=20
from the setting of his general environment, while precisely the=20
exact opposite would have been advantageous. In view of the=20
great unworldliness of our upper classes and their constantly=20
mounting estrangement from their own people, the army could=20
have exerted a particularly beneficial effect if in its own ranks,=20
at least, it had avoided any segregation of the so-called intelli=C2=AC=20
gentsia. That this was not done was a mistake; but what insti=C2=AC=20
tution in this world makes no mistakes? In this one, at any rate,=20
the good was so predominant that the few weaknesses lay far=20
beneath the average degree of human imperfection. 1=20

It must be attributed to the army of the old Reich as its high=C2=AC=20
est merit that at a time when heads were generally counted by=20
majorities, it placed heads above the majority. Confronted with=20
the Jewish-democratic idea of a blind worship of numbers, the=20
army sustained belief in personality. And thus it trained what=20
the new epoch most urgently needed: men. In the morass of a=20
universally spreading softening and effeminization, each year=20
three hundred and fifty thousand vigorous young men sprang=20
from the ranks of the army, men who in their two years=E2=80=99 train=C2=AC=
=20
ing had lost the softness of youth and achieved bodies hard as=20
steel. The young man who practiced obedience during this time=20
could then learn to command. By his very step you could recog=C2=AC=20
nize the soldier who had done his service.=20

This was the highest school of the German nation, and it was=20
not for nothing that the bitterest hatred of those who from=20
envy and greed needed and desired the impotence of the Reich=20
and the defenselessness of its citizens was concentrated on it.=20
What many Germans in their blindness or ill will did not want to=20
see was recognized by the foreign world: the German army was=20
the mightiest weapon serving the freedom of the German nation=20
and the sustenance of its children.=20

The third in the league, along with the state form and the=20
army, was the incomparable civil service of the old Reich.=20

Germany was the best organized and best administered country=20
in the world. The German government official might well be=20
accused of bureaucratic red tape, but in the other countries=20
things were no better in this respect; they were worse. But what=20
the other countries did not possess was the wonderful solidity of=20
this apparatus and the incorruptible honesty of its members. It=20
was better to be a little old-fashioned, but honest and loyal, than=20
enlightened and modern, but of inferior character and, as is=20
often seen today, ignorant and incompetent. For if today people=20
like to pretend that the German administration of the pre-War=20
period, though bureaucratically sound, was bad from a business=20
point of view, only the following answer can be given: what=20
country in the world had an institution better directed and better=20
organized in a business sense than Germany=E2=80=99s state railways?=20
It was reserved to the revolution to go on wrecking this exem=C2=AC=20
plary apparatus until at last it seemed ripe for being taken out=20
of the hands of the nation and socialized according to the lights=20
of this Republic=E2=80=99s founders; in other words, made to serve inter=C2=
=AC=20
national stock exchange capital, the power behind the German=20
revolution.=20

What especially distinguished the German civil service and=20
administrative apparatus was their independence from the indi=C2=AC=20
vidual governments whose passing political views could have no=20
effect on the job of German civil servant. Since the revolution, it=20
must be admitted, this has completely changed. Ability and=20
competence were replaced by party ties and a self-reliant, inde=C2=AC=20
pendent character became more of a hindrance than a help.=20

The state form, the army, and the civil service formed the=20
basis for the old Reich=E2=80=99s wonderful power and strength. These=20
first and foremost were the reasons for a quality which is totally=20
lacking in the present-day state: state=E2=80=99s authority! For this is=20
not based on bull-sessions in parliaments or provincial diets, or=20
on laws for its protection, or court sentences to frighten those=20
who insolently deny it, etc., but on the general confidence which=20


The Ultimate Cause oe the Collapse=20


283=20


may and can be placed in the leadership and administration of a=20
commonwealth. This confidence, in turn, results only from an=20
unshakable inner faith in the selflessness and honesty of the gov=C2=AC=20
ernment and administration of a country and from an agreement=20
between the spirit of the laws and the general ethical view. For=20
in the long run government systems are not maintained by the=20
pressure of violence, but by faith in their soundness and in the.=20
truthfulness with which they represent and advance the interests=20
of a people.=20


# # #=20


Gravely as certain evils of the pre-War period corroded and=20
threatened to undermine the inner strength of the nation, it=20
must not be forgotten that other states suffered even more than=20
Germany from most of these ailments and yet in the critical hour=20
of danger did not flag and perish. But if we consider that the=20
German weaknesses before the War were balanced by equally=20
great strengths, the ultimate cause of the collapse can and must=20
lie in a different field; and this is actually the case.=20

The deepest and ultimate reason for the decline of the old=20
Reich lay in its failure to recognize the racial problem and its=20
importance for the historical development of peoples. For events=20
in the lives of peoples are not expressions of chance, but processes=20
related to the self-preservation and propagation of the species=20

T=20

A here are some truths which are so obvious=20
that for this very reason they are not seen or at least not recog=C2=AC=20
nized by ordinary people. They sometimes pass by such truisms=20
as though blind and are most astonished when someone suddenly=20
discovers what everyone really ought to know. Columbus=E2=80=99s eggs=20
lie around by the hundreds of thousands, but Columbuses are=20
met with less frequently.=20

Thus men without exception wander about in the garden of=20
Nature; they imagine that they know practically everything and=20
yet with few exceptions pass blindly by one of the most patent=20
principles of Nature=E2=80=99s rule: the inner segregation of the species=
=20
of all living beings on this earth.=20

Even the most superficial observation shows that Nature=E2=80=99s=20
restricted form of propagation and increase is an almost rigid=20
basic law of all the innumerable forms of expression of her vital=20
urge. Every animal mates only with a member of the same=20
species. The titmouse seeks the titmouse, the finch the finch, the=20
stork the stork, the field mouse the field mouse, the dormouse=20
the dormouse, the wolf the she-wolf, etc.=20

Only unusual circumstances can change this, primarily the com=C2=AC=20
pulsion of captivity or any other cause that makes it impossible=20
to mate within the same species. But then Nature begins to=20
resist this with all possible means, and her most visible protest=20
consists either in refusing further capacity for propagation to=20


Race=20


285=20


bastards or in limiting the fertility of later offspring; in most=20
cases, however, she takes away the power of resistance to disease=20
or hostile attacks.=20

This is only too natural.=20

Any crossing of two beings not at exactly the same level pro=C2=AC=20
duces a medium between the level of the two parents. This=20
means: the offspring will probably stand higher than the racially=20
lower parent, but not as high as the higher one. Consequently, it=20
will later succumb in the struggle against the higher level. Such=20
mating is contrary to the will of Nature for a higher breeding of=20
all life. The precondition for this does not lie in associating=20
superior and inferior, but in the total victory of the former. The=20
stronger must dominate and not blend with the weaker, thus=20
sacrificing his own greatness. Only the born weakling can view=20
this as cruel, but he after all is only a weak and limited man;=20
for if this law did not prevail, any conceivable higher development=20
of organic living beings would be unthinkable.=20

The consequence of this racial purity, 1 universally valid in=20
Nature, is not only the sharp outward delimitation of the vari=C2=AC=20
ous races, but their uniform character in themselves. The fox is=20
always a fox, the goose a goose, the tiger a tiger, etc., and the=20
difference can lie at most in the varying measure of force, strength,=20
intelligence, dexterity, endurance, etc., of the individual speci=C2=AC=20
mens. But you will never find a fox who in his inner attitude=20
might, for example, show humanitarian tendencies toward geese,=20
as similarly there is no cat with a friendly inclination toward mice.=20

Therefore, here, too, the struggle among themselves arises=20
less from inner aversion than from hunger and love. In both=20
cases, Nature looks on calmly, with satisfaction, in fact. In the=20
struggle for daily bread all those who are weak and sickly or less=20
determined succumb, while the struggle of the males for the=20
female grants the right or opportunity to propagate only to the=20
healthiest. And struggle is always a means for improving a=20
species=E2=80=99 health and power of resistance and, therefore, a cause of=
=20
its higher development.=20

If the process were different, all further and higher develop=C2=AC=20
ment would cease and the opposite would occur. For, since the=20
inferior always predominates numerically over the best, if both=20
had the same possibility of preserving life and propagating, the=20
inferior would multiply so much more rapidly that in the end=20
the best would inevitably be driven into the background, unless=20
a correction of this state of affairs were undertaken. Nature does=20
just this by subjecting the weaker part to such severe living=20
conditions that by them alone the number is limited, and by not=20
permitting the remainder to increase promiscuously, but making=20
a new and ruthless choice according to strength and health.=20

No more than Nature desires the mating of weaker with=20
stronger individuals, even less does she desire the blending of a=20
higher with a lower race, since, if she did, her whole work of=20
higher breeding, over perhaps hundreds of thousands of years,=20
night be ruined with one blow.=20

Historical experience offers countless proofs of this. It shows=20
with terrifying clarity that in every mingling of Aryan blood=20
with that of lower peoples the result was the end of the cultured=20
people. North America, whose population consists in by far the=20
largest part of Germanic elements who mixed but little with the=20
lower colored peoples, shows a different humanity and culture=20
from Central and South America, where the predominantly Latin=20
immigrants often mixed with the aborigines on a large scale.=20
By this one example, we can clearly and distinctly recognize the=20
effect of racial mixture. The Germanic inhabitant of the Ameri=C2=AC=20
can continent, who has remained racially pure and unmixed,=20
rose to be master of the continent; he will remain the master as=20
long as he does not fall a victim to defilement of the blood.=20

The result of all racial crossing is therefore in brief always=20
the following:=20

(a) Lowering of the level of the higher race;=20

(b) Physical and intellectual regression and hence the begin=C2=AC=20
ning of a slowly but surely progressing sickness.=20

To bring about such a development is, then, nothing else but=20
to sin against the will of the eternal creator.=20


Consequences of Racial Crossing=20


287=20


And as a sin this act is rewarded.=20

When man attempts to rebel against the iron logic of Nature,=20
he comes into struggle with the principles to which he himself=20
owes his existence as a man. And this attack 1 must lead to his=20
own doom.=20

Here, of course, we encounter the objection of the modern=20
pacifist, as truly Jewish in its effrontery as it is stupid! =E2=80=98Man=
=E2=80=99s=20
role is to overcome Nature!=E2=80=99=20

Millions thoughtlessly parrot this Jewish nonsense and end up=20
by really imagining that they themselves represent a kind of=20
conqueror of Nature; though in this they dispose of no other=20
weapon than an idea, and at that such a miserable one, that if it=20
were true no world at all would be conceivable.=20

But quite aside from the fact that man has never yet conquered=20
Nature in anything, but at most has caught hold of and tried=20
to lift' one or another corner of her immense gigantic veil of=20
eternal riddles and secrets, that in reality he invents nothing but=20
only discovers everything, that he does not dominate Nature,=20
but has only risen on the basis of his knowledge of various laws=20
and secrets of Nature to be lord over those other living creatures=20
who lack this knowledge =E2=80=94 quite aside from all this, an idea can=C2=
=AC=20
not overcome the preconditions for the development and being=20
of humanity, since the idea itself depends only on man. Without=20
human beings there is no human idea in this world, therefore,=20
the idea as such is always conditioned by the presence of human=20
beings and hence of all the laws which created the precondition=20
for their existence.=20

And not only that! Certain ideas are even tied up with certain=20
men. This applies most of all to those ideas whose content origi=C2=AC=20
nates, not in an exact scientific truth, but in the world of emo=C2=AC=20
tion, or, as it is so beautifully and clearly expressed today, re=C2=AC=20

to do with cold logic as such, but represent only pure expressions=20
of feeling, ethical conceptions, etc., are chained to the existence=20
of men, to whose intellectual imagination and creative power=20

they owe their existence. Precisely in this case the preservation=20
of these definite races and men is the precondition for the existence=20
of these ideas. Anyone, for example, who really desired the vic=C2=AC=20
tory of the pacifistic idea in this world with all his heart would=20
have to fight with all the means at his disposal for the conquest=20
of the world by the Germans; for, if the opposite should occur,=20
the last pacifist would die out with the last German, since the=20
rest of the world has never fallen so deeply as our own people,=20
unfortunately, has for this nonsense so contrary to Nature and=20
reason. Then, if we were serious, whether we liked it or not, we=20
would have to wage wars in order to arrive at pacifism. This and=20
nothing else was what Wilson, the American world savior, in=C2=AC=20
tended, or so at least our German visionaries believed =E2=80=94 and=20
thereby his purpose was fulfilled.=20

In actual fact the pacifistic-humane idea is perfectly all right=20
perhaps when the highest type of man has previously conquered=20
and subjected the world to an extent that makes him the sole=20
ruler of this earth. Then this idea lacks the power of producing=20
evil effects in exact proportion as its practical application be=C2=AC=20
comes rare and finally impossible. Therefore, first struggle and=20
then we shall see what can be done. 1 Otherwise mankind has=20
passed the high point of its development and the end is not the=20
domination of any ethical idea but barbarism and consequently=20
chaos. At this point someone or other may laugh, but this planet=20
once moved through the ether for millions of years without=20
human beings and it can do so again some day if men forget that=20
they owe their higher existence, not to the ideas of a few crazy=20
ideologists, but to the knowledge and ruthless application of=20
Nature=E2=80=99s stern and rigid laws.=20

Everything we admire on this earth today =E2=80=94 science and art,=20
technology and inventions =E2=80=94 is only the creative product of a=20
few peoples and originally perhaps of one race. On them depends=20
the existence of this whole culture. If they perish, the beauty=20
of this earth will sink into the grave with them.=20

However much the soil, for example, can influence men, the=20

result of the influence will always be different depending on the=20
races in question. The low fertility of a living space may spur=20
the one race to the highest achievements; in others it will only=20
be the cause of bitterest poverty and final undernourishment with=20
all its consequences. The inner nature of peoples is always de=C2=AC=20
termining for the manner in which outward influences will be=20
effective. What leads the one to starvation trains the other to=20
hard work.=20

All great cultures of the past perished only because the origi=C2=AC=20
nally creative race died out from blood poisoning.=20

The ultimate cause of such a decline was their forgetting that=20
all culture depends on men and not conversely; hence that to=20
preserve a certain culture the man who creates it must be pre=C2=AC=20
served. This preservation is bound up with the rigid law of=20
necessity and the right to victory of the best and stronger in this=20
world.*=20

Those who want to live, let them fight, and those who do not=20
want to fight in this world of eternal struggle do not deserve to live.=20

Even if this were hard =E2=80=94 that is how it is! Assuredly, however,=20
by far the harder fate is that which strikes the man who thinks=20
he can overcome Nature, but in the last analysis only mocks her.=20
Distress, misfortune, and diseases are her answer.=20

The man who misjudges and disregards the racial laws actually=20
forfeits the happiness that seems destined to be his. He thwarts=20
the triumphal march of the best race and hence also the precon=C2=AC=20

Mein Kampf=20


It is idle to argue which race or races were the original repre=C2=AC=20
sentative of human culture and hence the real founders of all=20
that we sum up under the word =E2=80=98 humanity.=E2=80=99 It is simpler to=
=20
raise this question with regard to the present, and here an easy,=20
clear answer results. All the human culture, all the results of=20
art, science, and technology that we see before us today, are=20
almost exclusively the creative product of the Aryan. This very=20
fact admits of the not unfounded inference that he alone was=20
the founder of all higher humanity, therefore representing the=20
prototype of all that we understand by the word 'man.' He is=20
the Prometheus of mankind from whose bright forehead the=20
divine spark of genius has sprung at all times, forever kindling=20
anew that fire of knowledge which illumined the night of silent=20
mysteries and thus caused man to climb the path to mastery=20
over the other beings of this earth. Exclude him =E2=80=94 and perhaps=20
after a few thousand years darkness will again descend on the=20
earth, human culture will pass, and the world turn to a desert.=20

If we were to divide mankind into three groups, the founders=20
of culture, the bearers of culture, the destroyers of culture, only=20
the Aryan could be considered as the representative of the first=20
group. From him originate the foundations and walls of all=20
human creation, and only the outward form and color are de=C2=AC=20
termined by the changing traits of character of the various=20
peoples. He provides the mightiest building stones and plans for=20
all human progress and only the execution corresponds to the=20
nature of the varying men and races. In a few decades, for ex=C2=AC=20
ample, the entire east of Asia will possess a culture whose ulti=C2=AC=20
mate foundation will be Hellenic spirit and Germanic technology,=20
just as much as in Europe. Only the outward form =E2=80=94 in part at=20
least =E2=80=94 will bear the features of Asiatic character. It is not true=
,=20
as some people think, that Japan adds European technology to=20
its culture; no, European science and technology are trimmed with=20
Japanese characteristics. The foundation of actual life is no=20
longer the special Japanese culture, although it determines the=20
color of life =E2=80=94 because outwardly, in consequence of its inner=20
difference, it is more conspicuous to the European =E2=80=94 but the=20


The Culture-Founding Aryan=20


291=20


gigantic scientific-technical achievements of Europe and America;=20
that is, of Aryan peoples. Only on the basis of these achievements=20
can the Orient follow general human progress. They furnish=20
the basis of the struggle for daily bread, create weapons and=20
implements for it, and only the outward form is gradually=20
adapted to Japanese character.=20

If beginning today all further Aryan influence on Japan should=20
stop, assuming that Europe and America should perish, Japan=E2=80=99s=20
present rise in science and technology might continue for a short=20
time; but even in a few years the well would dry up, the Japanese=20
special character would gain, but the present culture would freeze=20
and sink back into the slumber from which it was awakened=20
seven decades ago by the wave of Aryan culture. Therefore, just=20
as the present Japanese development owes its life to Aryan=20
origin, long ago in the gray past foreign influence and foreign=20
spirit awakened the Japanese culture of that time. The best=20
proof of this is furnished by the fact of its subsequent sclerosis=20
and total petrifaction. This can occur in a people only when the=20
original creative racial nucleus has been lost, or if the external=20
influence which furnished the impetus and the material for the=20
first development in the cultural field was later lacking. But if it=20
is established that a people receives the most essential basic=20
materials of its culture from foreign races, that it assimilates and=20
adapts them, and that then, if further external influence is lack=C2=AC=20
ing, it rigidities again and again, such a race may be designated as=20
=E2=80=98culture-bearing =E2=80=99 but never as =E2=80=98 culture-creating =

of the various peoples from this standpoint points to the fact that=20
practically none .of them were originally culture-founding , but=20
almost always culture-bearing.=20

Approximately the following picture of their development=20

Aryan races =E2=80=94 often absurdly small numerically =E2=80=94 subject=20

tions of the new territory (fertility, climatic conditions, etc.) and=20

disposal as helpers, develop the intellectual and organizational=20

capacities dormant within them. Often in a few millenniums or=20
even centuries they create cultures which originally bear all the=20
inner characteristics of their nature, adapted to the above-=20
indicated special qualities of the soil and subjected beings. In=20
the end, however, the conquerors transgress against the princi=C2=AC=20
ple of blood purity, to which they had first adhered; they begin=20
to mix with the subjugated inhabitants and thus end their own=20
existence; for the fall of man in paradise has always been fol=C2=AC=20
lowed by his expulsion.=20

After a thousand years and more, the last visible trace of the=20
former master people is often seen in the lighter skin color which=20
its blood left behind in the subjugated race, and in a petrified=20
culture which it had originally created. For, once the actual and=20
spiritual conqueror lost himself in the blood of the subjected=20
people, the fuel for the torch of human progress was lost! Just=20
as, through the blood of the former masters, the color preserved=20
a feeble gleam in their memory, likewise the night of cultural life=20
is gently illumined by the remaining creations of the former light-=20
bringers. They shine through all the returned barbarism and too=20
often inspire the thoughtless observer of the moment with the=20
opinion that he beholds the picture of the present people before=20
him, whereas he is only gazing into the mirror of the past.=20

It is then possible that such a people will a second time, or even=20
more often in the course of its history, come into contact with=20
the race of those who once brought it culture, and the memory=20
of former encounters will not necessarily be present. Uncon=C2=AC=20
sciously the remnant of the former master blood will turn toward=20
the new arrival, and what was first possible only by compulsion=20
can now succeed through the people=E2=80=99s own will. A new cultural=20
wave makes its entrance and continues until those who have=20
brought it are again submerged in the blood of foreign peoples.=20

It will be the task of a future cultural and world history to=20
carry on researches in this light and not to stifle in the rendition=20
of external facts, as is so often, unfortunately, the case with our=20
present historical science.=20

decline =E2=80=94 of the true culture-founders of this earth, the Aryans=20
themselves.=20

As in daily life the so-called genius requires a special cause,=20
indeed, often a positive impetus, to make him shine, likewise the=20
genius-race in the life of peoples. In the monotony of everyday=20
life even significant men often seem insignificant, hardly rising=20
above the average of their environment; as soon, however, as=20
they are approached by a situation in which others lose hope or=20
go astray, the genius rises manifestly from the inconspicuous=20
average child, not seldom to the amazement of all those who had=20
hitherto seen him in the pettiness of bourgeois life =E2=80=94 and that is=
=20
why the prophet seldom has any honor in his own country. No=C2=AC=20
where have we better occasion to observe this than in war.=20
From apparently harmless children, in difficult hours when=20
others lose hope, suddenly heroes shoot up with death-defying=20
determination and an icy cool presence of mind. 1 If. this hour of=20
trial had not come, hardly anyone would ever have guessed that=20
a young hero was hidden in this beardless boy. It nearly always=20
takes some stimulus to bring the genius on the scene. The ham=C2=AC=20
mer-stroke of Fate which throws one man to the ground suddenly=20
strikes steel in another, and when the shell of everyday life is=20
broken, the previously hidden kernel lies open before the eyes of=20
the astonished world. The world then resists and does not want=20
to believe that the type which is apparently identical with it is=20
suddenly a very different being; a process which is repeated=20
with every eminent son of man.=20

Though an inventor, for example, establishes his fame only on=20
the day of his invention, it is a mistake to think that genius as=20
such entered into the man only at this hour =E2=80=94 the spark of genius=
=20
exists in the brain of the truly creative man from the hour of his=20
birth. True genius is always inborn and never cultivated, let=20
alone learned.=20

As already emphasized, this applies not only to the individual=20
man but also to the race. Creatively active peoples always have=20

11 eisige Kiihle der Uberlegungd=20


294=20


Mein Kampf=20


a fundamental creative gift, even if it should not be recognizable=20
to the eyes of superficial observers. Here, too, outward recogni=C2=AC=20
tion is possible only in consequence of accomplished deeds, since=20
the rest of the world is not capable of recognizing genius in itself,=20
but sees only its visible manifestations in the form of inventions,=20
discoveries, buildings, pictures, etc.; here again it often takes a=20
long time before the world can fight its way through to this=20
knowledge. Just as in the life of the outstanding individual,=20
genius or extraordinary ability strives for practical realization=20
only when spurred on by special occasions, likewise in the life=20
of nations the creative forces and capacities which are present=20
can often be exploited only when definite preconditions invite.=20

We see this most distinctly in connection with the race which=20
has been and is the bearer of human cultural development =E2=80=94 the=20
Aryans. As soon as Fate leads them toward special conditions,=20
their latent abilities begin to develop in a more and more rapid=20
sequence and to mold themselves into tangible forms. The cul=C2=AC=20
tures which they found in such cases are nearly always decisively=20
determined by the existing soil, the given climate, and =E2=80=94 the=20
subjected people. This last item, to be sure, is almost the most=20
decisive. The more primitive the technical foundations for a cul=C2=AC=20
tural activity, the more necessary is the presence of human=20
helpers who, organizationally assembled and employed, must=20
replace the force of the machine. Without this possibility of=20
using lower human beings, the Aryan would never have been=20
able to take his first steps toward his future culture; just as=20
without the help of various suitable beasts which he knew how=20
to tame, he would not have arrived at a technology which is now=20
gradually permitting him to do without these beasts. The say=C2=AC=20

unfortunately has only too deep a meaning. For thousands of=20

car, is making the horse superfluous. In a few years his activity=20
will have ceased, but without his previous collaboration man=20
might have had a hard time getting where he is today.=20

Thus, for the formation of higher cultures the existence of=20
lower human types was one of the most essential preconditions,=20
since they alone were able to compensate for the lack of technical=20
aids without which a higher development is not conceivable. It=20
is certain that the first culture of humanity was based less on the=20
tamed animal than on the use of lower human beings.=20

fate strike beasts, and not the other way around, as some people=20
would like to think. For first the conquered warrior drew the=20
plow =E2=80=94 and only after him the horse. Only pacifistic fools can=20
regard this as a sign of human depravity, failing to realize that=20
this development had to take place in order to reach the point=20
where today these sky-pilots could force their drivel on the world.=20

The progress of humanity is like climbing an endless ladder; it=20
is impossible to climb higher without first taking the lower steps.=20
Thus, the Aryan had to take the road to which reality directed=20
him and not the one that would appeal to the imagination of a=20
modern pacifist. The road of reality is hard and difficult, but in=20
the end it leads where our friend would like to bring humanity by=20
dreaming, but unfortunately removes more than bringing it=20
closer.=20

Hence it is no accident that the first cultures arose in places=20
where the Aryan, in his encounters with lower peoples, subju=C2=AC=20
gated them and bent them to his will. They then became the=20
first technical instrument in the service of a developing culture.=20

Thus, the road which the Aryan had to take was clearly marked=20
out. As a conqueror he subjected the lower beings and regulated=20
their practical activity under his command, according to his will=20
and for his aims. But in directing them to a useful, though ardu=C2=AC=20
ous activity, he not only spared the life of those he subjected;=20
perhaps he gave them a fate that was better than their previous=20
so-called =E2=80=98freedom,=E2=80=99 As long as he ruthlessly upheld the ma=
ster=20

Mein Kampe=20


attitude, not only did he really remain master, but also the=20
preserver and increaser of culture. For culture was based ex=C2=AC=20
clusively on his abilities and hence on his actual survival. As=20
soon as the subjected people began to raise themselves up and=20
probably approached the conqueror in language, the sharp divid=C2=AC=20
ing wall between master and servant fell. The Aryan gave up=20
the purity of his blood and, therefore, lost his sojourn in the=20
paradise which he had made for himself. He became submerged=20
in the racial mixture, and gradually, more and more, lost his=20
cultural capacity, until at last, not only mentally but also physi=C2=AC=20
cally, he began to resemble the subjected aborigines more than=20
his own ancestors. For a time he could live on the existing cul=C2=AC=20
tural benefits, but then petrifaction set in and he fell a prey to=20
oblivion.=20

Thus cultures and empires collapsed to make place for new=20
formations.=20

Blood mixture and the resultant drop in the racial level is the=20
sole cause of the dying out of old cultures; for men do not perish=20
as a result of lost wars, but by the loss of that force of resistance=20
which is contained only in pure blood.=20

All who are not of good race in this world are chaff.=20

And all occurrences in world history are only the expression of=20
the races=E2=80=99 instinct of self-preservation, in the good or bad sense.=
=20


The question of the inner causes of the Aryan=E2=80=99s importance=20
can be answered to the effect that they are to be sought less in a=20
natural instinct of self-preservation than in the special type of=20
its expression. The will to live, subjectively viewed, is everywhere=20
equal and different only in the form of its actual expression. In=20
the most primitive living creatures the instinct of self-preserva=C2=AC=20
tion does not go beyond concern for their own ego. Egoism, as=20
we designate this urge, goes so far that it even embraces time;=20
the moment itself claims everything, granting nothing to the=20


Service of the Community=20


297=20


coming hours. In this condition the animal lives only for him=C2=AC=20
self, seeks food only for his present hunger, and fights only for=20
his own life. As long as the instinct of self-preservation expresses=20
itself in this way, every basis is lacking for the formation of a=20
group, even the most primitive form of family. Even a com=C2=AC=20
munity between male and female beyond pure mating, demands=20
an extension of the instinct of self-preservation, since concern=20
and struggle for the ego are now directed toward the second party;=20
the male sometimes seeks food for the female, too, but for the=20
most part both seek nourishment for the young. Nearly always=20
one comes to the defense of the other, and thus the first, though=20
infinitely simple, forms of a sense of sacrifice result. As soon as=20
this sense extends beyond the narrow limits of the family, the=20
basis for the formation of larger organisms and finally formal=20
states is created.=20

In the lowest peoples of the earth this quality is present only to=20
a very slight extent, so that often they do not go beyond the=20
formation of the family. The greater the readiness to subordinate=20
purely personal interests, the higher rises the ability to establish=20
comprehensive communities.=20

This self-sacrificing will to give one=E2=80=99s personal labor and if=20
necessary one=E2=80=99s own life for others is most strongly developed in=
=20
the Aryan. The Aryan is not greatest in his mental qualities as=20
such, but in the extent of his willingness to put all his abilities in=20
the service of the community. In him the instinct of self-pres=C2=AC=20
ervation has reached the noblest form, since he willingly sub=C2=AC=20
ordinates his own ego to the life of the community and, if the=20
hour demands, even sacrifices it.=20

Not in his intellectual gifts lies the source of the Aryan=E2=80=99s capac=
=C2=AC=20
ity for creating and building culture. If he had just this alone,=20
he could only act destructively, in no case could he organize;=20
for the innermost essence of all organization requires that the=20
individual renounce putting forward his personal opinion and=20
interests and sacrifice both in favor of a larger group. Only by=20
way of this general community does he again recover his share.=20
Now, for example, he no longer works directly for himself, but=20


298=20


Mein Kampf=20


with his activity articulates himself with the community, not=20
only for his own advantage, but for the advantage of all. The=20
most wonderful elucidation of this attitude is provided by his=20
word =E2=80=98 work,=E2=80=99 by which he does not mean an activity for mai=
ntain=C2=AC=20
ing life in itself, but exclusively a creative effort that does not=20
conflict' with the interests of the community. Otherwise he=20
designates human activity, in so far as it serves the instinct of=20
self-preservation without consideration for his fellow men, as=20
theft, usury, robbery, burglary, etc.=20

This state of mind, which subordinates the interests of the ego=20
to the conservation of the community, is really the first premise=20
for every truly human culture. From it alone can arise all the=20
great works of mankind, which bring the founder little reward,=20
but the richest blessings to posterity. Yes from it alone can we=20
understand how so many are able to bear up faithfully under a=20
scanty life which imposes on them nothing but poverty and frugal=C2=AC=20
ity, but gives the community the foundations of its existence.=20
Every worker, every peasant, every inventor, official, etc., who=20
works without ever being able to achieve any happiness or=20
prosperity for himself, is a representative of this lofty idea, even=20
if the deeper meaning of his activity remains hidden in him.=20

What applies to work as the foundation of human sustenance=20
and all human progress is true to an even greater degree for the=20
defense of man and his culture. In giving one=E2=80=99s own life for the=20
existence of the community lies the crown of all sense of sacrifice.=20
It is this alone that prevents what human hands have built from=20
being overthrown by human hands or destroyed by Nature.=20

Our own German language possesses a word which magnifi=C2=AC=20
cently designates this kind of activity: Pflichterfilllung (fulfill=C2=AC=
=20
ment of duty); it means not to be self-sufficient but to serve the=20
community.=20

The basic attitude from which such activity arises, we call =E2=80=94=20
to distinguish it from egoism and selfishness =E2=80=94 idealism. By this=
=20
we understand only the individual=E2=80=99s capacity to make sacrifices=20
for the community, for his fellow men.=20

How necessary it is to keep realizing that idealism does not=20


Idealism and Knowledge=20


299=20


represent a superfluous expression of emotion, but that in truth=20
it has been, is, and will be, the premise for what we designate as=20
human culture, yes, that it alone created the concept of =E2=80=98man=E2=80=
=99!=20
It is to this inner attitude that the Aryan owes his position in=20
this world, and to it the world owes man; for it alone formed from=20
pure spirit the creative force which, by a unique pairing of the=20
brutal fist and the intellectual genius, created the monuments of=20
human culture.=20

Without his idealistic attitude all, even the most dazzling=20
faculties of the intellect, would remain mere intellect as such =E2=80=94=
=20
outward appearance without inner value, and never creative force.=20

But, since true idealism is nothing but the subordination of the=20
interests and life of the individual to the community, and this in=20
turn is the precondition for the creation of organizational forms=20
of all kinds, it corresponds in its innermost depths to the ultimate=20
will of Nature. It alone leads men to voluntary recognition of=20
the privilege of force and strength, and thus makes them into a=20
dust particle of that order which shapes and forms the whole=20
universe.=20

The purest idealism is unconsciously equivalent to the deepest=20
knowledge.=20

How correct this is, and how little true idealism has to do with=20
playful flights of the imagination, can be seen at once if we let=20
the unspoiled child, a healthy boy, for example, judge. The same=20
boy who feels like throwing up 1 when he hears the tirades of a=20
pacifist =E2=80=98idealist=E2=80=99 is ready to give his young life for the=
 ideal of=20
his nationality.=20

Here the instinct of knowledge unconsciously obeys the deeper=20
necessity of the preservation of the species, if necessary at the=20
cost of the individual, and protests against the visions of the=20
pacifist windbag who in reality is nothing but a cowardly, though=20
camouflaged, egoist, transgressing the laws of development; for=20
development requires willingness on the part of the individual to=20
sacrifice himself for the community, and not the sickly imaginings=20
of cowardly know-it-alls and critics of Nature.=20

Especially, therefore, at times when the ideal attitude threatens=20
to disappear, we can at once recognize a diminution of that force=20
which forms the community and thus creates the premises of=20
culture. As soon as egoism becomes the ruler of a people, the=20
bands of order are loosened and in the chase after their own=20
happiness men fall from heaven into a real hell.=20

Yes, even posterity forgets the men who have only served their=20
own advantage and praises the heroes who have renounced their=20
own happiness.=20

The mightiest counterpart to the Aryan is represented by the=20
Jew. In hardly any people in the world is the instinct of self-=20
preservation developed more strongly than in the so-called=20

=E2=80=98chosen/ Of this, the mere fact of the survival of this race may=20

be considered the best proof. Where is the people which in the=20
last two thousand years has been exposed to so slight changes of=20
inner disposition, character, etc., as the Jewish people? What=20
people, finally, has gone through greater upheavals than this=20
one =E2=80=94 and nevertheless issued from the mightiest catastrophes=20
of mankind unchanged? What an infinitely tough will to live=20
and preserve the species speaks from these facts!=20

The mental qualities of the Jew have been schooled in the=20
course of many centuries. Today he passes as =E2=80=98smart/ and this in=20
a certain sense he has been at all times. But his intelligence is=20
not the result of his own development, but of visual instruction=20
through foreigners. For the human mind cannot climb to . the=20
top without steps; for every step upward he needs the founda=C2=AC=20
tion of the past, and this in the comprehensive sense in which it=20
can be revealed only in general culture. All thinking is based=20
only in small part on man=E2=80=99s own knowledge, and mostly on the=20
experience of the time that has preceded. The general cultural=20
level provides the individual man, without his noticing it as=20
a rule, with such a profusion of preliminary knowledge that, thus=20


Consequences of Jewish Egotism=20


301=20


armed, he can more easily take further steps of his own. The boy=20
of today, for example, grows up among a truly vast number of=20
technical acquisitions of the last centuries, so that he takes for=20
granted and no longer pays attention to much that a hundred=20
years ago was a riddle to even the greatest minds, although for=20
following and understanding our progress in the field in question=20
it is of decisive importance to him. If a very genius from the=20
twenties of the past century should suddenly leave his grave=20
today, it would be harder for him even intellectually to find his=20
way in the present era than for an average boy of fifteen today.=20
For he would lack all the infinite preliminary education which=20
our present contemporary unconsciously, so to speak, assimilates=20
while growing up amidst the manifestations of our present=20
general civilization.=20

Since the Jew =E2=80=94 for reasons which will at once become appar=C2=AC=
=20
ent =E2=80=94 was never in possession of a culture of his own, the foun=C2=
=AC=20
dations of his intellectual work were always provided by others.=20
His intellect at all times developed through the cultural world=20
surrounding him.=20

The reverse process never took place.=20

For if the Jewish people=E2=80=99s instinct of self-preservation is not=20
smaller but larger than that of other peoples, if his intellectual=20
faculties can easily arouse the impression that they are equal to=20
the intellectual gifts of other races, he lacks completely the most=20
essential requirement for a cultured people, the idealistic attitude.=20

In the Jewish people the will to self-sacrifice does not go beyond=20
the individual=E2=80=99s naked instinct of self-preservation. Their appar=
=C2=AC=20
ently great sense of solidarity is based on the very primitive=20
herd instinct that is seen in many other living creatures in this=20
world. It is a noteworthy fact that the herd instinct leads to=20
mutual support only as long as a common danger makes this=20
seem useful or inevitable. The same pack of wolves which has=20
just fallen on its prey together disintegrates when hunger abates=20
into its individual beasts. The same is true of horses which try=20
to defend themselves against an assailant in a body, but scatter=20
again as soon as the danger is past.=20


302=20


Mein Kampf=20


It is similar with the Jew. His sense of sacrifice is only appar=C2=AC=20
ent. It exists only as long as the existence of the individual makes=20
it absolutely necessary. However, as soon as the common enemy=20
is conquered, the danger threatening all averted and the booty=20
hidden, the apparent harmony of the Jews among themselves=20
ceases, again making way for their old causal 1 tendencies. The=20
Jew is only united when a common danger forces him to be or=20
a common booty entices him; if these two grounds are lacking,=20
the qualities of the crassest egoism come into their own, and in=20
the twinkling of an eye the united people turns into a horde of=20
rats, fighting bloodily among themselves.=20

If the Jews were alone in this world, they would stifle in filth=20
and offal; they would try to get ahead of one another in hate-=20
filled struggle and exterminate one another, in so far as the ab=C2=AC=20
solute absence of all sense of self-sacrifice, expressing itself in=20
their cowardice, did not turn battle into comedy here too.=20

So it is absolutely wrong to infer any ideal sense of sacrifice=20
in the Jews from the fact that they stand together in struggle, or,=20
better expressed, in the plundering of their fellow men.=20

Here again the Jew is led by nothing but the naked egoism of=20
the individual.=20

That is why the Jewish state =E2=80=94 which should be the living=20
organism for preserving and increasing a race =E2=80=94 is completely=20
unlimited as to territory. For a state formation to have a definite=20
spatial setting always presupposes an, idealistic attitude on the=20
part of the state-race, and especially a correct interpretation of=20
the concept of work. In the exact measure in which this attitude=20
is lacking, any attempt at forming, even of preserving, a spatially=20
delimited state fails. And thus the basis on which alone culture=20
can arise is lacking.=20

Hence the Jewish people, despite all apparent intellectual=20
qualities, is without any true culture, and especially without any=20
culture of its own. For what sham culture the Jew today pos-=20

Their originally existing tendencies.=E2=80=99=20


Sham Culture of the Jew=20


303=20


sesses is the property of other peoples, and for the most part it=20
is ruined in his hands.=20

In judging the Jewish people=E2=80=99s attitude on the question of=20
human culture, the most essential characteristic we must always=20
bear in mind is that there has never been a Jewish art and ac=C2=AC=20
cordingly there is none today either; that above all the two queens=20
of all the arts, architecture and music, owe nothing original to=20
the Jews. What they do accomplish in the field of art is either=20
patchwork or intellectual theft. Thus, the Jew lacks those=20
qualities which distinguish the races that are creative and hence=20
culturally blessed.=20

To what an extent the Jew takes over foreign culture, imitating=20
or rather ruining it, can be seen from the fact that he is mostly=20
found in the art which seems to require least original invention,=20
the art of acting. But even here, in reality, he is only a =E2=80=98juggler=
/=20
or rather an ape; for even here he lacks the last touch that is=20
required for real greatness; even here he is not the creative genius,=20
but a superficial imitator, and all the twists and tricks that he=20
uses are powerless to conceal the inner lifelessness of his creative=20
gift. Here the Jewish press most lovingly helps him along by=20
raising such a roar of hosannahs about even the most mediocre=20
bungler, just so long as he is a Jew, that the rest of the world=20
actually ends up by thinking that they have an artist before=20
them, while in truth it is only a pitiful comedian.=20

No, the Jew possesses no culture-creating force of any sort,=20
since the idealism, without which there is no true higher deveh=20
opment of man, is not present in him and never was present.=20
Hence his intellect will never have a constructive effect, but will=20
be destructive, and in very rare cases perhaps will at most be=20
stimulating, but then as the prototype of the =E2=80=98 force which always=
=20
wants evil and nevertheless creates good .=E2=80=99 1 Not through him=20
does any progress of mankind occur, but in spite of him.=20

Since the Jew never possessed a state with definite territorial=20
limits and therefore never called a culture his own, the concep=C2=AC=20
tion arose that this was a people which should be reckoned among=20

1 Goethe=E2=80=99s Faust , lines 1336-1337: Mephistopheles to Faust.=20


304=20

the ranks of the nomads. This is a fallacy as great as it is danger=C2=AC=
=20
ous. The nomad does possess a definitely limited living space,=20
only he does not cultivate it like a sedentary peasant, but lives=20
from the yield of his herds with which he wanders about in his=20
territory. The outward reason for this is to be found in the small=20
fertility of a soil which simply does not permit of settlement.=20
The deeper cause, however, lies in the disparity between the=20
technical culture of an age or people and the natural poverty of=20
a living space. There are territories in which even the Aryan is=20
enabled only by his technology, developed in the course of more=20
than a thousand years, to live in regular settlements, to master=20
broad stretches of soil and obtain from it the requirements of=20
life. If he did not possess this technology, either he would have=20
to avoid these territories or likewise have to struggle along as=20
a nomad in perpetual wandering, provided that his'thousand-=20
year-old education and habit of settled residence did not make=20
this seem simply unbearable to him. We must bear in mind=20
that in the time when the American continent was being opened=20
up, numerous Aryans fought for their livelihood as trappers,=20
hunters, etc., and often in larger troops with wife and children,=20
always on the move, so that their existence was completely like=20
that of the nomads. But as soon as their increasing number=20
and better implements permitted them to clear the wild soil and=20
make a stand against the natives, more and more settlements=20
sprang up in the land.=20

Probably the Aryan was also first a nomad, settling in the=20
course of time, but for that very reason he was never a Jew!=20
No, the Jew is no nomad; for the nomad had also a definite atti=C2=AC=20
tude toward the concept of work which could serve as a basis=20
for his later development in so far as the necessary intellectual=20
premises were present. In him the basic idealistic view is present,=20
even if in infinite dilution, hence in his whole being he may seem=20
strange to the Aryan peoples, but not unattractive. In the Jew,=20
however, this attitude is not at all present; for that reason he=20
was never a nomad, but only and always a parasite in the body of=20
other peoples. That he sometimes left his previous living space=20

"A=20


The Jew a Parasite=20


305=20


has nothing to do with his own purpose, but results from the=20
fact that from time to time he was thrown out by the host=20
nations he had misused. His spreading is a typical phenomenon=20
for all parasites; he always seeks a new feeding ground for his=20
race.=20

This, however, has nothing to do with nomadism, for the reason=20
that a Jew never thinks of leaving a territory that he has occu=C2=AC=20
pied, but remains where he is, and he sits so fast that even by=20
force it is very hard to drive him out. His extension to ever-new=20
countries occurs only in the moment in which certain conditions=20
for his existence are there present, without which =E2=80=94 unlike the=20
nomad =E2=80=94 he would not change his residence. He is and remains=20
the typical parasite, a sponger who like a noxious bacillus keeps=20
spreading as soon as a favorable medium invites him. And the=20
effect of his existence is also like that of spongers: wherever he=20
appears, the host people dies out after a shorter or longer period.=20

Thus, the Jew of all times has lived in the states of other=20
peoples, and there formed his own state, which, to be sure,=20
habitually sailed under the disguise of =E2=80=98religious community=E2=80=
=99 as=20
long as outward circumstances made a complete revelation of=20
his nature seem inadvisable. But as soon as he felt strong enough=20
to do without the protective cloak, he always dropped the veil=20
and suddenly became what so many of the others previously=20
did not want to believe and see: the Jew.=20

The Jew=E2=80=99s life as a parasite in the body of other nations and=20
states explains a characteristic which once caused Schopenhauer,=20
as has already been mentioned, to call him the =E2=80=98great master in=20
lying.=E2=80=99 Existence impels the Jew to lie, and to lie perpetually,=20
just as it compels the inhabitants of the northern countries to=20
wear warm clothing.=20

His life within other peoples can only endure for any length of=20
time if he succeeds in arousing the opinion that he is not a people=20
but a =E2=80=98religious community,=E2=80=99 though of a special sort.=20

And this is the first great lie.=20

In order to carry on his existence as a parasite on other peoples,=20
he is forced to deny his inner nature. The more intelligent the=20


306=20


Mein Kampf=20


individual Jew is, the more he will succeed in this deception.=20
Indeed, things can go so far that large parts of the host people=20
will end by seriously believing that the Jew is really a French=C2=AC=20
man or an Englishman, a German or an Italian, though of a=20
special religious faith. Especially state authorities, which always=20
seem animated by the historical fraction of wisdom, most easily=20
fall a victim to this infinite deception. Independent thinking=20
sometimes seems to these circles a true sin against holy advance=C2=AC=20
ment, so that we may not be surprised if even today a Bavarian=20
state ministry, for example, still has not the faintest idea that=20
the Jews are members of a people and not of a =E2=80=98 religion =E2=80=99 =
though a=20
glance at the Jew=E2=80=99s own newspapers should indicate this even to=20
the most modest mind. The Jewish Echo is not yet an official=20
organ, of course, and consequently is unauthoritative as far as=20
the intelligence of one of these government potentates is con=C2=AC=20
cerned.=20

The Jew has always been a people with definite racial char=C2=AC=20
acteristics and never a religion; only in order to get ahead he=20
early sought for a means which could distract unpleasant atten=C2=AC=20
tion from his person. And what would have been more expedient=20
and at the same time more innocent than the =E2=80=98embezzled=E2=80=99 con=
=C2=AC=20
cept of a religious community? For here, too, everything is bor=C2=AC=20
rowed or rather stolen. Due to his own original special nature,=20
the Jew cannot possess a religious institution, if for no other=20
reason because he lacks idealism in any form, and hence belief=20
in a hereafter is absolutely foreign to him. And a religion in the=20
Aryan sense cannot be imagined which lacks the conviction of=20
survival after death in some form. Indeed, the Talmud is not a=20
book to prepare a man for the hereafter, but only for a practical=20
and profitable life in this world.=20

The Jewish religious doctrine consists primarily in prescriptions=20
for keeping the blood of Jewry pure and for regulating the relation=20
of Jews among themselves, but even more with the rest of the=20
world; in other words, with non Jews. But even here it is by=20
no means ethical problems that are involved, but extremely=20
modest economic ones. Concerning the moral value of Jewish=20


Jewish Religious Doctrine=20


307=20


religious instruction, there are today and have been at all times=20
rather exhaustive studies (not by Jews; the drivel of the Jews=20
themselves on the subject is, of course, adapted to its purpose)=20
which make this kind of religion seem positively monstrous ac=C2=AC=20
cording to Aryan conceptions. The best characterization is pro=C2=AC=20
vided by the product of this religious education, the Jew himself.=20
His life is only of this world, and his spirit is inwardly as alien=20
to true Christianity as his nature two thousand years previous=20
was to the great founder of the new doctrine. Of course, the=20
latter made no secret of his attitude toward the Jewish people,=20
and when necessary he even took to the whip to drive from the=20
temple of the Lord this adversary of all humanity, who then=20
as always saw in religion nothing but an instrument for his busi=C2=AC=20
ness existence. In return, Christ was nailed to the cross, while=20
our present-day party Christians debase themselves to begging=20
for Jewish votes at elections and later try to arrange political=20
swindles with atheistic Jewish parties =E2=80=94 and this against their=20
own nation.=20

On this first and greatest lie, that the Jews are not a race but=20
a religion, more and more lies are based in necessary consequence.=20
Among them is the lie with regard to the language of the Jew.=20
For him it is not a means for expressing his thoughts, but a means=20
for concealing them. When he speaks French, he thinks Jewish,=20
and while he turns out German verses, in his life he only expresses=20
the nature of his nationality. As long as the Jew has not become=20
the master of the other peoples, he must speak their languages=20
whether he likes it or not, but as soon as they became his slaves,=20
they would all have to learn a universal language (Esperanto, for=20
instance!), so that by this additional means the Jews could more=20
easily dominate them!=20

To what an extent the whole existence of this people is based=20
on a continuous lie is shown incomparably by the Protocols of the=20
Wise Men of Zion , so infinitely hated by the Jews. They are=20
based on a forgery, the Frankfurter Zeitung moans and screams=20
once every week: the best proof that they are authentic. What=20
many Jews may do unconsciously is here consciously exposed.=20


308=20


Mein Kampf=20


And that is what matters. It is completely indifferent from what=20
Jewish brain these disclosures originate; the important thing is=20
that with positively terrifying certainty they reveal the nature=20
and activity of the Jewish people and expose their inner contexts=20
as well as their ultimate final aims. The best criticism applied=20
to them, however, is reality. Anyone who examines the historical=20
development of the last hundred years from the standpoint of=20
this book will at once understand the screaming of the Jewish=20
press. For once this book has become the common property of=20
a people, the Jewish menace may be considered as broken.=20

The best way to know the Jew is to study the road which he=20
has taken within the body of other peoples in the course of the=20
centuries. It suffices to follow this up in only one example, to=20
arrive at the necessary realizations. As his development has=20
always and at all times been the same, just as that of the peoples=20
corroded by him has also been the same, it is advisable in such=20
an examination to divide his development into definite sections=20
which in this case for the sake of simplicity I designate alpha=C2=AC=20
betically. The first Jews came to ancient Germany in the course=20
of the advance of the Romans, and as always they came as mer=C2=AC=20
chants. In the storms of the migrations, however, they seem to=20
have disappeared again, and thus the time of the first Germanic=20
state formation may be viewed as the beginning of a new and=20
this time lasting Jewification of Central and Northern Europe.=20
A development set in which has always been the same or similar=20
wherever the Jews encountered Aryan peoples.=20

Development of Jewry=20


309=20


taches little importance to the concealment of his nationality.=20
He is still a Jew, partly perhaps among other reasons because the=20
outward racial difference between himself and the host people=20
is too great, his linguistic knowledge still too small, and the=20
cohesion of the host people too sharp for him to dare to try to=20
appear as anything else than a foreign merchant. With his dex=C2=AC=20
terity and the inexperience of his host people, the retention of=20
his character as a Jew represents no disadvantage for him, but=20
rather an advantage; the stranger is given a friendly reception.=20

(b) Gradually he begins slowly 1 to become active in economic=20
life, not as a producer, but exclusively as a middleman. With=20
his thousand-year-old mercantile dexterity he is far superior to=20
the still helpless, and above all boundlessly honest, Aryans, so=20
that in a short time commerce threatens to become his monopoly.=20
He begins to lend money and as always at usurious interest.=20
As a matter of fact, he thereby introduces interest. The danger=20
of this new institution is not recognized at first, but because of=20
its momentary advantages is even welcomed.=20

(c) The Jew has now become a steady resident; that is, he=20
settles special sections of the cities and villages and more and=20
more constitutes a state within a state. He regards commerce as=20
well as all financial transactions as his own special privilege=20
which he ruthlessly exploits.=20

(d) Finance and commerce have become his complete monop=C2=AC=20
oly. His usurious rates of interest finally arouse resistance, the=20
rest of his increasing effrontery indignation, his wealth envy.=20
The cup is full to overflowing when he draws the soil into the=20
sphere of his commercial objects and degrades it to the level of a=20
commodity to be sold or rather traded. Since he himself never=20
cultivates the soil, but regards it only as a property to be ex=C2=AC=20
ploited on which the peasant can well remain, though amid the=20
most miserable extortions on the part of his new master, the=20
aversion against him gradually increases to open hatred. His=20
blood-sucking tyranny becomes so great that excesses against=20
him occur. People begin to look at the foreigner more and more=20

11 Allmahlich beginnt er sich langsam ...=E2=80=99=20


310=20


Mein Kampf=20


closely and discover more and more repulsive traits and char=C2=AC=20
acteristics in him until the cleft becomes unbridgeable.=20

At times of the bitterest distress, fury against him finally=20
breaks out, and the plundered and ruined masses begin to defend=20
themselves against the scourge of God. In the course of a few=20
centuries, they have come to know him, and now they feel that=20
the mere fact of his existence is as bad as the plague.=20

(e) Now the Jew begins to reveal his true qualities. With=20
repulsive flattery he approaches the governments, puts his money=20
to work, and in this way always manages to secure new license=20
to plunder his victims. Even though the rage of the people some=C2=AC=20
times flares high against the eternal blood-sucker, it does not in=20
the least prevent him from reappearing in a few years in the=20
place he had hardly left and beginning the old life all over again.=20
No persecution can deter him from his type of human- exploita=C2=AC=20
tion, none can drive him away; after every persecution he is=20
back again in a short time, and just the same as before.=20

To prevent the very worst, at least, the people begin to with=C2=AC=20
draw the soil from his usurious hands by making it legally im=C2=AC=20
possible for him to acquire soil.=20

(f) Proportionately as the power of the princes begins to=20
mount, he pushes closer and closer to them. He begs for =E2=80=98 patents=
=E2=80=99=20
and =E2=80=98privileges,=E2=80=99 which the lords, always in financial stra=
its, are=20
glad to give him for suitable payment. However much this may=20
cost him, he recovers the money he has spent in a few years=20
through interest and compound interest. A true blood-sucker=20
that attaches himself to the body of the unhappy people and can=C2=AC=20
not be picked off until the princes themselves again need money=20
and with their own exalted hand tap off the blood he has sucked=20
from them.=20

This game is repeated again and again, and in it the role of the=20
so-called =E2=80=98German princes=E2=80=99 is just as miserable as that of =
the=20
Jews themselves. These lords were really God=E2=80=99s punishment for=20
their beloved peoples and find their parallels only in the various=20
ministers of the present time.=20

It is thanks to the German princes that the German nation=20


Development of Jewry=20


311=20


was unable to redeem itself for good from the Jewish menace.=20
In this, too, unfortunately, nothing changed as time went on; all=20
they obtained from the Jew was the thousandfold reward for the=20
sins they had once committed against their peoples. They made=20
a pact with the devil and landed in hell.=20

(g) And so, his ensnarement of the princes leads to their ruin.=20
Slowly but surely their relation to the peoples loosens in the=20
measure in which they cease to serve the people=E2=80=99s interests and=20
instead become mere exploiters of their subjects. The Jew well=20
knows what their end will be and tries to hasten it as much as=20
possible. He himself adds to their financial straits by alienating=20
them more and more from their true tasks, by crawling around=20
them with the vilest flattery, by encouraging them in vices, and=20
thus making himself more and more indispensable to them. With=20
his deftness, or rather unscrupulousness, in all money matters he=20
is able to squeeze, yes, to grind, more and more money out of the=20
plundered subjects, who in shorter and shorter intervals go the=20
way of all flesh. Thus every court has its =E2=80=98court Jew=E2=80=99 =E2=
=80=94 as the=20
monsters are called who torment the =E2=80=98 beloved people =E2=80=99 to d=
espair=20
and prepare eternal pleasures for the princes. Who then can be=20
surprised that these ornaments of the human race ended up by=20
being ornamented, or rather decorated, in the literal sense, and=20
rose to the hereditary nobility, helping not only to make this=20
institution ridiculous, but even to poison it?=20

Now, it goes without saying, he can really make use of his=20
position for his own advancement.=20

Finally he needs only to have himself baptized to possess him=C2=AC=20
self of all the possibilities and rights of the natives of the country.=20
Not seldom he concludes this deal to the joy of the churches over=20
the son they have won and of Israel over the successful swindle.=20

(h) Within Jewry a change now begins to take place. Up till=20
now they have been Jews; that is, they attach no importance to=20
appearing to be something else, which they were unable to do,=20
anyway, because of the very distinct racial characteristics on=20
both sides. At the time of Frederick the Great it srill entered no=20
one=E2=80=99s head to regard the Jew as anything else but a =E2=80=98 forei=
gn =E2=80=99=20


312=20


Mein Kampf=20


people, and Goethe was still horrified at the thought that in future=20
marriage between Christians and Jews would no longer be for=C2=AC=20
bidden by law. And Goethe, by God, was no reactionary, let=20
alone a helot ; 1 what spoke out of him was only the voice of the=20
blood and of reason. Thus =E2=80=94 despite all the shameful actions of=20
the courts =E2=80=94 the people instinctively saw in the Jew a foreign=20
element and took a corresponding attitude toward him.=20

But now all this was to change. In the course of more than a=20
thousand years he has learned the language of the host people to=20
such an extent that he now thinks he can venture in future to=20
emphasize his Judaism less and place his =E2=80=98Germanism=E2=80=99 more i=
n=20
the foreground; for ridiculous, nay, insane, as it may seem at=20
first, he nevertheless has the effrontery to turn 1 Germanic,=E2=80=99 in=
=20
this case a * German.=E2=80=99 With this begins one of the most infamous=20
deceptions that anyone could conceive of. Since of Germanism he=20
possesses really nothing but the art of stammering its language=20
=E2=80=94 and in the most frightful way =E2=80=94 but apart from this has n=
ever=20
mixed with the Germans, his whole Germanism rests on the=20
language alone. Race, however, does not lie in the language, but=20
exclusively in the blood, which no one knows better than the Jew,=20
who attaches very little importance to the preservation of his=20
language, but all importance to keeping his blood pure. A man=20
can change his language without any trouble =E2=80=94 that is, he can use=
=20
another language; but in his new language he will express the old=20
ideas; his inner nature is not changed. This is best shown by the=20
Jew who can speak a thousand languages and nevertheless re=C2=AC=20
mains a Jew. His traits of character have remained the same,=20
whether two thousand years ago as a grain dealer in Ostia, speak=C2=AC=20
ing Roman, or whether as a flour profiteer of today, jabbering=20
German with a Jewish accent. It is always the same Jew. That=20
this obvious fact is not understood by a ministerial secretary or=20
higher police official is also self-evident, for there is scarcely any=20
creature with less instinct and intelligence running around in the=20
world today than these servants of our present model state au=C2=AC=20
thority.=20

The reason why the Jew decides suddenly to become a f Ger=C2=AC=20
man =E2=80=99 is obvious. He feels that the power of the princes is slowly=
=20
tottering and therefore tries at an early time to get a platform=20
beneath his feet. Furthermore, his financial domination of the=20
whole economy has advanced so far that without possession of all=20
=E2=80=98civil=E2=80=99 rights he can no longer support the gigantic edific=
e, or at=20
any rate, no further increase of his influence is possible. And he=20
desires both of these; for the higher he climbs, the more alluring=20
his old goal that was once promised him rises from the veil of the=20
past, and with feverish avidity his keenest minds see the dream of=20
world domination tangibly approaching. And so his sole effort=20
is directed toward obtaining full possession of =E2=80=98civil=E2=80=99 rig=
hts.=20

This is the reason for his emancipation from the ghetto.=20

(i) So from the court Jew there gradually develops the people=E2=80=99s=20
Jew, which means, of course: the Jew remains as before in the=20
entourage of the high lords; in fact, he tries to push his way even=20
more into their circle; but at the same time another part of his=20
race makes friends with the =E2=80=98beloved people.=E2=80=99 If we conside=
r how=20
greatly he has sinned against the masses in the course of the cen=C2=AC=20
turies, how he has squeezed and sucked their blood again and=20
again; if furthermore, we consider how the people gradually=20
learned to hate him for this, and ended up by regarding his exist=C2=AC=20
ence as nothing but a punishment of Heaven for the other peo=C2=AC=20
ples, we can understand how hard this shift must be for the Jew.=20
Yes, it is an arduous task suddenly to present himself to his=20
flayed victims as a =E2=80=98friend of mankind.=E2=80=99=20

First, therefore, he goes about making up to the people for his=20
previous sins against them. He begins his career as the =E2=80=98bene=C2=AC=
=20
factor=E2=80=99 of mankind. Since his new benevolence has a practical=20
foundation, he cannot very well adhere to the old Biblical recom=C2=AC=20
mendation, that the left hand should not know what the right=20
hand giveth; no, whether he likes it or not, he must reconcile=20
himself to letting as many people as possible know how deeply=20
he feels the sufferings of the masses and all the sacrifices that he=20
himself is making to combat them. With this =E2=80=98modesty=E2=80=99 which=
 is=20
inborn in him, he blares out his merits to the rest of the world=20


314=20


Mein Kampf=20


until people really begin to believe in them. Anyone who does=20
not believe in them is doing him a bitter injustice. In a short time=20
he begins to twist things around to make it look as if all the in=C2=AC=20
justice in the world had always been done to him and not the=20
other way around. The very stupid believe this and then they=20
just can=E2=80=99t help but pity the poor =E2=80=98 unfortunate.=E2=80=99=
=20

In addition, it should be remarked here that the Jew, despite=20
all his love of sacrifice, naturally never becomes personally im=C2=AC=20
poverished. He knows how to manage; sometimes, indeed, his=20
charity is really comparable to fertilizer, which is not strewn on=20
the field for love of the field, but with a view to the farmer=E2=80=99s ow=
n=20
future benefit. In any case, everyone knows in a comparatively=20
short time that the Jew has become a =E2=80=98benefactor and friend=20
of mankind.=E2=80=99 What a strange transformation!=20

But what is more or less taken for granted in others arouses=20
the greatest astonishment and in many distinct admiration for=20
this very reason. So it happens that he gets much more credit=20
for every such action than the rest of mankind, in whom it is=20
taken for granted.=20

But even more: all at once the Jew also becomes liberal and=20
begins to rave about the necessary progress of mankind.=20

Slowly he makes himself the spokesman of a new era.=20

Also, of course, he destroys more and more thoroughly the=20
foundations of any economy that will really benefit the people.=20
By way of stock shares he pushes his way into the circuit of na=C2=AC=20
tional production which he turns into a purchasable or rather=20
tradable object, thus robbing the enterprises of the foundations=20
of a personal ownership. Between employer and employee there=20
arises that inner estrangement which later leads to political class=20
division.=20

Finally, the Jewish influence on economic affairs grows with=20
terrifying speed through the stock exchange. He becomes=20
the owner, or at least the controller, of the national labor=20
force.=20

To strengthen his political position he tries to tear down the=20
racial and civil barriers which for a time continue to restrain him=20


Development of Jewry=20


315=20


at every step. To this end he fights with all the tenacity innate=20
in him for religious tolerance =E2=80=94 and in Freemasonry, which has=20
succumbed to him completely, he has an excellent instrument=20
with which to fight for his aims and put them across. The govern=C2=AC=20
ing circles and the higher strata of the political and economic=20
bourgeoisie are brought into his nets by the strings of Free=C2=AC=20
masonry, and never need to suspect what is happening.=20

Only the deeper and broader strata of the people as such, or=20
rather that class which is beginning to wake up and fight for its=20
rights and freedom, cannot yet be sufficiently taken in by these=20
methods. But this is more necessary than anything else; for the=20
Jew feels that the possibility of his rising to a dominant role=20
exists only if there is someone ahead of him to clear the way; and=20
this someone he thinks he can recognize in the bourgeoisie, in=20
their broadest strata in fact. The glovemakers and linen weavers,=20
however, cannot be caught in the fine net of Freemasonry; no, for=20
them coarser but no less drastic means must be employed. Thus,=20
Freemasonry is joined by a second weapon in the service of the=20
Jews: the press. With all his perseverance and dexterity he seizes=20
possession of it. With it he slowly begins to grip and ensnare, to=20
guide and to push all public life, since he is in a position to create=20
and direct that power which, under the name of =E2=80=98public opinion/=20
is better known today than a few decades ago.=20

In this he always represents himself personally as having an=20
infinite thirst for knowledge, praises all progress, mostly, to be=20
sure, the progress that leads to the ruin of others; for he judges=20
all knowledge and all development only according to its pos=C2=AC=20
sibilities for advancing his nation, and where this is lacking, he is=20
the inexorable mortal enemy of all light, a hater of all true culture.=20
He uses all the knowledge he acquires in the schools of other peo=C2=AC=20
ples, exclusively for the benefit of his race.=20

And this nationality he guards as never before. While he seems=20
to overflow with =E2=80=98 enlightenment/ =E2=80=98progress/ =E2=80=98freed=
om/ =E2=80=98human=C2=AC=20
ity/ etc., he himself practices the severest segregation of his race.=20
To be sure, he sometimes palms off his women on influential=20
Christians, but as a matter of principle he always keeps his malf=20


316=20


Mein Kampe=20


line pure. He poisons the blood of others, but preserves his own.=20
The Jew almost never marries a Christian woman; it is the Chris=C2=AC=20
tian who marries a Jewess. The bastards, however, take after the=20
Jewish side. Especially a part of the high nobility degenerates=20
completely. The Jew is perfectly aware of this, and therefore=20
systematically carries on this mode of =E2=80=98disarming ' the intellectua=
l=20
leader class of his racial adversaries. In order to mask his activity=20
and lull his victims, however, he talks more and more of the=20
equality of all men without regard to race and color. The fools=20
begin to believe him.=20

Since, however, his whole being still has too strong a smell of=20
the foreign for the broad masses of the people in particular to fall=20
readily into his nets, he has his press give a picture of him which=20
is as little in keeping with reality as conversely it serves his de=C2=AC=
=20
sired purpose. His comic papers especially strive to represent the=20
Jews as a harmless little people, with their own peculiarities, of=20
course =E2=80=94 like other peoples as well =E2=80=94 but even in their ges=
tures,=20
which seem a little strange, perhaps, giving signs of a possibly=20
ludicrous, but always thoroughly honest and benevolent, soul.=20
And the constant effort is to make him seem almost more =E2=80=98in=C2=AC=
=20
significant ' than dangerous.=20

His ultimate goal in this stage is the victory of =E2=80=98democracy/ or,=
=20
as he understands it: the rule of parliamentarianism. It is most=20
compatible with his requirements; for it excludes the personality=20
=E2=80=94 and puts in its place the majority characterized by stupidity,=20
incompetence, and last but not least, cowardice.=20

The final result will be the overthrow of the monarchy, which=20
is now sooner or later bound to occur.=20

(j) The tremendous economic development leads to a change=20

the truest sense of the word. His old age is a torment and can=20
scarcely be designated as living.=20

Once before, a similar situation was created, which pressed=20
Urgently for a solution and also found one. The peasants and=20
artisans had slowly been joined by the officials and salaried=20
workers =E2=80=94 particularly of the state =E2=80=94 as a new class. They,=
 too,=20
were propertyless in the truest sense of the word. The state=20
finally found a w r ay out of this unhealthy condition by assuming=20
the care of the state employee who could not himself provide for=20
his old age; it introduced the pension. Slowly, more and more=20
enterprises followed this example, so that nearly every regularly=20
employed brain-worker draws a pension in later life, provided the=20
concern he works in has achieved or surpassed a certain size.=20
Only by safeguarding the state official in his old age could he be=20
taught the selfless devotion to duty which in the pre-War period=20
was the most eminent quality of German officialdom.=20

In this way a whole class that had remained propertyless was=20
wisely snatched away from social misery and articulated with=20
the body of the people.=20

Now this question again, and this time on a much larger scale,=20
faced the state and the nation. More and more masses of people,=20
numbering millions, moved from peasant villages to the larger=20
cities to earn their bread as factory workers in the newly estab=C2=AC=20
lished industries. The working and living conditions of the new=20
class were more than dismal. If nothing else, the more or less=20
mechanical transference of the old artisan=E2=80=99s or even peasant=E2=80=
=99s=20
working methods to the new form was by no means suitable.=20
The work done by these men could not be compared with the=20
exertions which the industrial factory worker has to perform. In=20
the old handicraft, this may not have been very important, but=20
in the new working methods it was all the more so. The formal=20
transference of the old working hours to the industrial large-scale=20
enterprise was positively catastrophic, for the actual work done=20
before was but little in view of the absence of our present in=C2=AC=20
tensive working methods. Thus, though previously the fourteen-=20
or even fifteen-hour working day had been bearable, it certainly=20


318=20


Mein Kampf=20


ceased to be bearable at a time when every minute was exploited=20
to the fullest. The result of this senseless transference of the old=20
working hours to the new industrial activity was really unfortu=C2=AC=20
nate in two respects: the worker=E2=80=99s health was undermined and his=20
faith in a higher justice destroyed. To this finally was added the=20
miserable wages on the one hand and the employer=E2=80=99s correspond=C2=AC=
=20
ingly and obviously so vastly superior position on the other.=20

In the country there could be no social question, since master=20
and hired hand did the same work and above all ate out of the=20
same bowls. But this, too, changed.=20

The separation of worker and employer now seems complete in=20
all fields of life. How far the inner Judaization of our people has=20
progressed can be seen from the small respect, if not contempt,=20
that is accorded to manual labor. This is not German. It took=20
the foreignization of our life, which was in truth a Jewification,=20
to transform the old respect for manual work into a certain con=C2=AC=20
tempt for all physical labor.=20

Thus, there actually comes into being a new class enjoying=20
very little respect, and one day the question must arise whether=20
the nation would possess the strength to articulate the new class=20
into general society, or whether the social difference would=20
broaden into a classlike cleavage.=20

But one thing is certain: the new class did not count the worst=20
elements in its ranks, but on the contrary definitely the most=20
energetic elements. The overrefinements of so-called culture had=20
not yet exerted their disintegrating and destructive effects. The=20
broad mass of the new class was not yet infected with the poison=20
of pacifist weakness; it was robust and if necessary even brutal.=20

While the bourgeoisie is not at all concerned about this all-=20
important question, but indifferently lets things slide, the Jew=20
seizes the unlimited opportunity it offers for the future; while on=20
the one hand he organizes capitalistic methods of human ex=C2=AC=20
ploitation to their ultimate consequence, he approaches the very=20
victims of his spirit and his activity and in a short time becomes=20
the leader of their struggle against himself. =E2=80=98Against himself=E2=
=80=99 is=20
only figuratively speaking; for the great master of lies understands=20


Jewish Tactics=20


319=20


as always how to make himself appear to be the pure one and to=20
load the blame on others. Since he has the gall to lead the masses,=20
it never even enters their heads that this might be the most in=C2=AC=20
famous betrayal of all times.=20

And yet it was.=20

Scarcely has the new class grown out of the general economic=20
shift than the Jew, clearly and distinctly, realizes that it can open=20
the way for his own further advancement. First, he used the=20
bourgeoisie as a battering-ram against the feudal world, then the=20
worker against the bourgeois world. If formerly he knew how to=20
swindle his way to civil rights in the shadow of the bourgeoisie,=20
now he hopes to find the road to his own domination in the=20
worker=E2=80=99s struggle for existence.=20

From now on the worker has no other task but to fight for the=20
future of the Jewish people. Unconsciously he is harnessed to the=20
service of the power which he thinks he is combating. He is seem=C2=AC=20
ingly allowed to attack capital, and this is the easiest way of mak=C2=AC=
=20
ing him fight for it. In this the Jew keeps up an outcry against=20
international capital and in truth he means the national economy=20
which must be demolished in order that the international stock=20
exchange can triumph over its dead body.=20

Here the Jew=E2=80=99s procedure is as follows:=20

He approaches the worker, simulates pity with his fate, or even=20
indignation at his lot of misery and poverty, thus gaining his=20
confidence. He takes pains to study all the various real or=20
imaginary hardships of his life =E2=80=94 and to arouse his longing for a=
=20
change in such an existence. With infinite shrewdness he fans=20
the need for social justice, somehow slumbering in every Aryan=20
man, into hatred against those who have been better favored by=20
fortune, and thus gives the struggle for the elimination of social=20
evils a very definite philosophical stamp. He establishes the=20
Marxist doctrine.=20

By presenting it as inseparably bound up with a number of=20
socially just demands, he promotes its spread and conversely the=20
aversion of decent people to fulfill demands which, advanced in=20
such form and company, seem from the outset unjust and impos-=20


320=20


Mein Kampf=20


sible to fulfill. For under this cloak of purely social ideas truly=20
diabolic purposes are hidden, yes, they are publicly proclaimed=20
with the most insolent frankness. This theory represents an=20
inseparable mixture of reason and human madness, but always=20
in such a way that only the lunacy can become reality and never=20
the reason. By the categorical rejection of the personality and=20
hence of the nation and its racial content, it destroys the ele=C2=AC=20
mentary foundations of all human culture which is dependent on=20
just these factors. This is the true inner kernel of the Marxist=20
philosophy in so far as this figment of a criminal brain can be=20
designated as a =E2=80=98philosophy.=E2=80=99 With the shattering of the pe=
r=C2=AC=20
sonality and the race, the essential obstacle is removed to the=20
domination of the inferior being =E2=80=94 and this is the Jew.=20

Precisely in political and economic madness lies the sense of=20
this doctrine. For this prevents all truly intelligent people from=20
entering its service, while those who are intellectually less active=20
and poorly educated in economics hasten to it with flying colors.=20
The intellectuals for this movement =E2=80=94 for even this movement=20
needs intellectuals for its existence =E2=80=94 are =E2=80=98 sacrificed =
=E2=80=99 by the Jew=20
from his own ranks.=20

Thus there arises a pure movement entirely of manual workers=20
under Jewish leadership, apparently aiming to improve the situa=C2=AC=20
tion of the worker, but in truth planning the enslavement and=20
with it the destruction of all non-Jewish peoples.=20

The general pacifistic paralysis of the national instinct of self-=20
preservation begun by Freemasonry in the circles of the so-called=20
intelligentsia is transmitted to the broad masses and above all to=20
the bourgeoisie by the activity of the big papers which today are=20
always Jewish. Added to these two weapons of disintegration=20
comes a third and by far the most terrible, the organization of=20
brute force. As a shock and storm troop, Marxism is intended to=20
finish off what the preparatory softening up with the first two=20
weapons has made ripe for collapse.=20

Here we have teamwork that is positively brilliant =E2=80=94 and we=20
need really not be surprised if in confronting it those very in=C2=AC=20
stitutions which always like to represent themselves as the pillars=20


Organization of Marxist World Doctrine 321=20

of a more or less legendary state authority hold up least. It is in=20
our high and highest state officialdom that the Jew has at all times=20
(aside from a few exceptions) found the most compliant abettor of=20
his work of disintegration. Cringing submissiveness to superiors=20
and high-handed arrogance to inferiors distinguish this class to=20
the same degree as a narrow-mindedness that often cries to high=20
Heaven and is only exceeded by a self-conceit that is sometimes=20
positively amazing.=20

And these are qualities that the Jew needs in our authorities=20
and loves accordingly.=20

The practical struggle which now begins, sketched in broad=20
outlines, takes the following course:=20

In keeping with the ultimate aims of the Jewish struggle,=20
which are not exhausted in the mere economic conquest of the=20
world, but also demand its political subjugation, the Jew divides=20
the organization of his Marxist world doctrine into two halves=20
which, apparently separate from one another, in truth form an=20
inseparable whole: the political and the trade-union move=C2=AC=20
ment.=20

The trade-union movement does the recruiting. In the hard=20
struggle for existence which the worker must carry on, thanks=20
to the greed and shortsightedness of many employers, it offers=20
him aid and protection, and thus the possibility of winning better=20
living conditions. If, at a time when the organized national com=C2=AC=20
munity, the state, concerns itself with him little or not at all, the=20
worker does not want to hand over the defense of his vital human=20
rights to the blind caprice of people who in part have little sense=20
of responsibility and are often heartless to boot, he must take=20
their defense into his own hands. In exact proportion as the so-=20
called national bourgeoisie, blinded by financial interests, sets=20
the heaviest obstacles in the path of this struggle for existence=20
and not only resists all attempts at shortening the inhumanly=20
long working day, abolishing child labor, safeguarding and pro=C2=AC=20
tecting the woman, improving sanitary conditions in the work=C2=AC=20
shops and homes, but often actually sabotages them, the shrewder=20
Jew takes the oppressed people under his wing. Gradually he be-=20


322=20


Mein Kampe=20


comes the leader of the trade-union movement, all the more easily=20
as he is not interested in really eliminating social evils in an honest=20
sense, but only in training an economic storm troop, blindly de=C2=AC=20
voted to him, with which to destroy the national economic in=C2=AC=20
dependence. For while the conduct of a healthy social policy=20
will consistently move between the aims of preserving the na=C2=AC=20
tional health on the one hand and safeguarding an independent=20
national economy on the other, for the Jew in his struggle these=20
two criteria not only cease to exist, but their elimination, among=20
other things, is his life goal. He desires, not the preservation of=20
an independent national economy, but its destruction. Conse=C2=AC=20
quently, no pangs of conscience can prevent him as a leader of=20
the trade-union movement from raising demands which not only=20
overshoot the goal, but whose fulfillment is either impossible for=20
practical purposes or means the ruin of the national economy.=20
Moreover, he does not want to have a healthy, sturdy race before=20
him, but a rickety herd capable of being subjugated. This desire=20
again permits him to raise demands of the most senseless kind=20
whose practical fulfillment he himself knows to be impossible and=20
which, therefore, could not lead to any change in things, but at=20
most to a wild incitement of the masses. And that is what he is=20
interested in and not a true and honest improvement of social=20
conditions.=20

Hence the Jewish leadership in trade-union affairs remains=20
uncontested until an enormous work of enlightenment influences=20
the broad masses and sets them right about their never-ending=20
misery, or else the state disposes of the Jew and his work. For as=20
long as the insight of the masses remains as slight as now and the=20
state as indifferent as today, these masses will always be first to=20
follow the man who in economic matters offers the most shameless=20
promises. And in this the Jew is a master. For in his entire ac=C2=AC=20
tivity he is restrained by no moral scruples!=20

And so he inevitably drives every competitor in this sphere=20
from the field in a short time. In keeping with all his inner=20
rapacious brutality, he at once teaches the trade-union move=C2=AC=20
ment the most brutal use of violence. If anyone by his intelli-=20


Organization of Marxist World Doctrine 323=20


gence resists the Jewish lures, his defiance and understanding=20
are broken by terror. The success of such an activity is=20
enormous.=20

Actually the Jew by means of the trade union, which could be=20
a blessing for the nation, shatters the foundations of the national=20
economy.=20

Parallel with this, the political organization advances.=20

It plays hand in glove with the trade-union movement, for the=20
latter prepares the masses for political organization, in fact,=20
lashes them, into it with violence and coercion. Furthermore, it=20
is the permanent financial source from which the political or=C2=AC=20
ganization feeds its enormous apparatus. It is the organ con=C2=AC=20
trolling the political activity of the individual and does the pan=C2=AC=20
dering in all big demonstrations of a political nature. In the end=20
it no longer comes out for political interests at all, but places its=20
chief instrument of struggle, the cessation of work in the form of=20
a mass and general strike, in the service of the political idea.=20

By the creation of a press whose content is adapted to the in=C2=AC=20
tellectual horizon of the least educated people, the political and=20
trade-union organization finally obtains the agitational institu=C2=AC=20
tion by which the lowest strata of the nation are made ripe for=20
the most reckless acts. Its function is not to lead people out of=20
the swamp of a base mentality to a higher stage, but to cater to=20
their lowest instincts. Since the masses are as mentally lazy as=20
they are sometimes presumptuous, this is a business as specula=C2=AC=20
tive as it is profitable.=20

It is this press, above all, which wages a positively fanatical and=20
slanderous struggle, tearing down everything which can be re=C2=AC=20
garded as a support of national independence, cultural elevation,=20
and the economic independence of the nation.=20

Above all, it hammers away at the characters of all those who=20
will not bow down to the Jewish presumption to dominate, or=20
whose ability and genius in themselves seem a danger to the Jew.=20
For to be hated by the Jew it is not necessary to combat him; no,=20
it suffices if he suspects that someone might even conceive the=20
idea of combating him some time or that on the strength of his=20


324=20


Mein Kampf=20


superior genius he is an augmenter of the power and greatness of a=20
nationality hostile to the Jew.=20

His unfailing instinct in such things scents the original soul 1=20
in everyone, and his hostility is assured to anyone who is not spirit=20
of his spirit. Since the Jew is not the attacked but the attacker,=20
not only anyone who attacks passes as his enemy, but also any=C2=AC=20
one who resists him. But the means with which he seeks to break=20
such reckless but upright souls is not honest warfare, but lies and=20
slander.=20

Here he stops at nothing, and in his vileness he becomes so=20
gigantic that no one need be surprised if among our people the=20
personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the=20
living shape of the Jew.=20

The ignorance of the broad masses about the inner nature of=20
the Jew, the lack of instinct and narrow-mindedness of our upper=20
classes, make the people an easy victim for this Jewish campaign=20
of lies.=20

While from innate cowardice the upper classes turn away from=20
a man whom the Jew attacks with lies and slander, the broad=20
masses from stupidity or simplicity believe everything. The state=20
authorities either cloak themselves in silence or, what usually=20
happens, in order to put an end to the Jewish press campaign,=20
they persecute the unjustly attacked, which, in the eyes of such=20
an official ass, passes as the preservation of state authority and=20
the safeguarding of law and order.=20

Slowly fear of the Marxist weapon of Jewry descends like a=20
nightmare on the mind and soul of decent people.=20

They begin to tremble before the terrible enemy and thus have=20
become his final victim.=20

The Jew=E2=80=99s domination in the state seems so assured that now=20
not only can he call himself a Jew again, but he ruthlessly admits=20
his ultimate national and political designs. A section of his race=20
openly owns itself to be a foreign people, yet even here they lie.=20
For while the Zionists try to make the rest of the world believe=20
that the national consciousness of the Jew finds its satisfaction=20

from the intervention of other states: a haven for convicted=20

It is a sign of their rising confidence and sense of security that=20
at a time when one section is still playing the German, French=C2=AC=20
man, or Englishman, the other with open effrontery comes out as=20
the Jewish race.=20

How close they see approaching victory can be seen by the=20
hideous aspect which their relations with the members of other=20
peoples takes on.=20

With satanic joy in his face, the black-haired Jewish youth=20
lurks in wait for the unsuspecting girl whom he defiles with his=20
blood, thus stealing her from her people. With every means he=20
tries to destroy the racial foundations of the people he has set=20
out to subjugate. Just as he himself systematically ruins women=20
and girls, he does not shrink back from pulling down the blood=20
barriers for others, even on a large scale. It was and it is Jews=20
who bring the Negroes into the Rhineland, always with the same=20
secret thought and clear aim of ruining the hated white race by=20
the necessarily resulting bastardization, throwing it down from=20
its cultural and political height, and himself rising to be its=20
master. .=20

For a racially pure people which is conscious of its blood can=20
never be enslaved by the Jew. In this world he will forever be=20
master over bastards and bastards alone.=20

And so he tries systematically to lower the racial level by a=20
continuous poisoning of individuals.=20

And in politics he begins to replace the idea of democracy by=20
the dictatorship of the proletariat.=20

In the organized mass of Marxism he has found the weapon=20
which lets him dispense with democracy and in its stead allows=20

326=20


Mein Kampf=20


him to subjugate and govern the peoples with a dictatorial and=20

He works systematically for revolutionization in a twofold=20
sense: economic and political.=20

Around peoples who offer too violent a resistance to attack=20
from within he weaves a net of enemies, thanks to his interna=C2=AC=20
tional influence, incites them to war, and finally, if necessary,=20
plants the flag of revolution on the very battlefields.=20

In economics he undermines the states until the social enter=C2=AC=20
prises which have become unprofitable are taken from the state=20
and subjected to his financial control.=20

In the political field he refuses the state the means for its self-=20
preservation, destroys the foundations of all national self-main=C2=AC=20
tenance and defense, destroys faith in the leadership, scoffs at its=20
history and past, and drags everything that is truly great into=20
the gutter.=20

Culturally he contaminates art, literature, the theater, makes=20
a mockery of natural feeling, overthrows all concepts of beauty=20
and sublimity, of the noble and the good, and instead drags men=20
down into the sphere of his own base nature.=20

Religion is ridiculed, ethics and morality represented as out=C2=AC=20
moded, until the last props of a nation in its struggle for existence=20
in this world have fallen.=20

(e) 1 Now begins the great last revolution. In gaining political=20
power the Jew casts off the few cloaks that he still wears. The=20
democratic people=E2=80=99s Jew becomes the blood-Jew and tyrant over=20
peoples. In a few years he tries to exterminate the national in=C2=AC=20

lectual leadership makes them ripe for the slave=E2=80=99s lot of per=C2=AC=

The most frightful example of this kind is offered by Russia,=20
where he killed or starved about thirty million people with posi=C2=AC=20

to give a gang of Jewish journalists and stock exchange bandits=20

If we pass all the causes of the German collapse in review, the=20
ultimate and most decisive remains the failure to recognize the=20
racial problem and especially the Jewish menace.=20

The defeats on the battlefield in August, 1918, would have been=20
child's play to bear. They stood in no proportion to the victories=20
of our people. It was not they that caused our downfall; no, it=20
was brought about by that power which prepared these defeats=20
by systematically over many decades robbing our people of the=20
political and moral instincts and forces which alone make nations=20
capable and hence worthy of existence.=20

In heedlessly ignoring the question of the preservation of the=20
racial foundations of our nation, the old Reich disregarded the=20
sole right which gives life in this world. Peoples which bastardize=20
themselves, or let themselves be bastardized, sin against the will=20
of eternal Providence, and when their ruin is encompassed by a=20
stronger enemy it is not an injustice done to them, but only the=20
restoration of justice. If a people no longer wants to respect the=20
Nature-given qualities of its being which root in its blood, it has=20
no further right to complain over the loss of its earthly existence.=20

Everything on this earth is capable of improvement. Every=20
defeat can become the father of a subsequent victory, every lost=20
war the cause of a later resurgence, every hardship the fertiliza=C2=AC=20

a new spiritual rebirth can come =E2=80=94 as long as the blood is pre=C2=

The lost purity of the blood alone destroys inner happiness=20

Only by examining and comparing all other problems of life in=20
the light of this one question shall we see how absurdly petty=20
they are by this standard. They are all limited in time =E2=80=94 but the=
=20
question of preserving or not preserving the purity of the blood=20
will endure as long as there are men.=20

All really significant symptoms of decay of the pre-War period=20
can in the last analysis be reduced to racial causes.=20

Whether we consider questions of general justice or cankers=20
of economic life, symptoms of cultural decline or processes of=20
political degeneration, questions of faulty schooling or the bad=20
influence exerted on grown-ups by the press, etc., everywhere and=20
always it is fundamentally the disregard of the racial needs of=20
our own people or failure to see a foreign racial menace.=20

And that is why all attempts at reform, all works for social=20
relief and political exertions, all economic expansion and every=20
apparent increase of intellectual knowledge were futile as far as=20
their results were concerned. The nation, and the organism which=20
enables 1 and preserves its life on this earth, the state, did not=20
grow inwardly healthier, but obviously languished more and=20
more. All the illusory prosperity of the old Reich could not hide=20

Reich failed again and again, due to disregarding the most im=C2=AC=20

It would be a mistake to believe that the adherents of the vari=C2=AC=20
ous political tendencies which were tinkering around on the=20
German national body =E2=80=94 yes, even a certain section of the lead=C2=
=AC=20

was condemned to sterility only because the best of them saw at=20
most the forms of our general disease and tried to combat them,=20
but blindly ignored the virus. Anyone who systematically fol=C2=AC=20
lows the old Reich=E2=80=99s line of political development is bound to ar=
=C2=AC=20
rive, upon calm examination, at the realization that even at the=20
time of the unification, hence the rise of the German nation, the=20
inner decay was already in full swing, and that despite all ap-=20

parent political successes and despite increasing economic wealth,=20
the general situation was deteriorating from year to year. If=20
nothing else, the elections for the Reichstag announced, with their=20
outward swelling of the Marxist vote, the steadily approaching=20
inward and hence also outward collapse. All the successes of the=20
so-called bourgeois parties were worthless, not only because even=20
with so-called bourgeois electoral victories they were unable to=20
halt the numerical growth of the Marxist flood, but because they=20
themselves above all now bore the ferments of decay in their own=20
bodies. Without suspecting it, the bourgeois world itself was in=C2=AC=20
wardly infected with the deadly poison of Marxist ideas and its=20
resistance often sprang more from the competitor=E2=80=99s envy of am=C2=AC=
=20
bitious leaders than from a fundamental rejection of adversaries=20
determined to fight to the utmost. In these long years there was=20
only one who kept up an imperturbable, unflagging fight, and=20
this was the Jew. His Star of David 1 rose higher and higher in=20
proportion as our people=E2=80=99s will for self-preservation vanished.=20

Therefore, in August, 1914, it was not a people resolved to at=C2=AC=20
tack which rushed to the battlefield; no, it was only the last=20
flicker of the national instinct of self-preservation in face of the=20
progressing pacifist-Marxist paralysis of our national body.=20
Since even in these days of destiny, our people did not recognize=20
the inner enemy, all outward resistance was in vain and Provi=C2=AC=20
dence did not bestow her reward on the victorious sword, but=20
followed the law of eternal retribution.=20

On the basis of this inner realization, there took form in our new=20
movement the leading principles as well as the tendency, which=20
in our conviction were alone capable, not only of halting the de=C2=AC=20
cline of the German people, but of creating the granite foundation=20
upon which some day a state will rest which represents, not an=20

first period in the development of our movement and briefly dis=C2=AC=20
cuss a number of questions it raises, my aim is not to give a dis=C2=AC=20
sertation on the spiritual aims of the movement. The aims and=20
tasks of the new movement are so gigantic that they can only=20
be treated in a special volume. In a second volume, therefore,=20
I shall discuss the programmatic foundations of the movement in=20
detail and attempt to draw a picture of what we conceive of undei=20
the word *state.=E2=80=99 By =E2=80=98us=E2=80=99 I mean all the hundreds o=
f thousands=20
who fundamentally long for the same thing without as individuals=20
finding the words to describe outwardly 1 what they inwardly=20
visualize; for the noteworthy fact about all reforms is that at=20
first they possess but a single champion yet many million sup=C2=AC=20
porters. Their aim has often been for centuries the inner longing=20
of hundreds of thousands, until one man stands up to proclaim=20
such a general will, and as a standard-bearer guides the old long=C2=AC=20
ing to victory in the form of the new idea.=20

The fact that millions bear in their hearts the desire for a=20
basic change in the conditions obtaining today proves the deep=20
discontent under which they suffer. It expresses itself in thou=C2=AC=20
sandfold manifestations, with one in despair and hopelessness,=20
with another in ill will, anger, and indignation; with this man in=20
indifference, and with that man in furious excesses. As witnesses=20

to this inner dissatisfaction we may consider those who are weary=20
of elections as well as the many who tend to the most fanatical=20
extreme of the Left.=20

The young movement was intended primarily to appeal to=20
these last. It is not meant to constitute an organization of the=20
contented and satisfied, but to embrace those tormented by=20
suffering, those without peace, the unhappy and the discontented,=20
and above all it must not swim on the surface of a national body,=20
but strike roots deep within it.=20

In purely political terms, the following picture presented itself=20
in 1918: a people torn into two parts. The one, by far the smaller,=20
includes the strata of the national intelligentsia, excluding all the=20
physically active. It is outwardly national, yet under this word=20
can conceive of nothing but a very insipid and weak-kneed de=C2=AC=20
fense of so-called state interests, which in turn seem identical with=20
dynastic interests. They attempt to fight for their ideas and=20
aims with spiritual weapons which are as fragmentary as they=20
are superficial, and which fail completely in the face of the=20
enemy=E2=80=99s brutality. With a single frightful blow this class, which=
=20
only a short time before was still governing, is stretched on the=20
ground and with trembling cowardice suffers every humiliation=20
at the hands of the ruthless victor.=20

Confronting it is a second class, the broad mass of the laboring=20
population. It is organized in more or less radical Marxist move=C2=AC=20
ments, determined to break all spiritual resistance by the power=20
of violence. It does not want to be national, but consciously=20
rejects any promotion of national interests, just as, conversely,=20
it aids and abets all foreign oppression. It is numerically the=20
stronger and above all comprises all those elements of the nation=20
without which a national resurrection is unthinkable and im=C2=AC=20
possible.=20

For in 1918 this much was clear: no resurrection of the German=20


332=20


Mein Kampf=20


people can occur except through the recovery of outward power.=20
But the prerequisites for this are not arms, as our bourgeois=20
* statesmen =E2=80=99 keep prattling, but the forces of the will. The Germa=
n=20
people had more than enough arms before. They were not able=20
to secure freedom because the energies of the national instinct=20
of self-preservation, the will for self-preservation, were lacking.=20
The best weapon is dead, worthless material as long as the spirit=20
is lacking which is ready, willing, and determined to use it.=20
Germany became defenseless, not because arms were lacking,=20
but because the will was lacking to guard the weapon for=20
national survival.=20

If today more than ever our Left politicians are at pains to=20
point out the lack of arms as the necessary cause of their spine=C2=AC=20
less, compliant, actually treasonous policy, we must answer only=20
one thing: no, the reverse is true. Through your anti-national,=20
criminal policy of abandoning national interests, you surrendered=20
our arms. Now you attempt to represent the lack of arms as the=20
underlying cause of your miserable villainy. This, like every=C2=AC=20
thing you do, is lies and falsification.=20

But this reproach applies just as much to the politicians on=20
the Right. For, thanks to their miserable cowardice, the Jewish=20
rabble that had come to power was able in 1918 to steal the=20
nation=E2=80=99s arms. They, too, have consequently no ground and no=20
right to palm off our present lack of arms as the compelling=20
ground for their wily caution (read =E2=80=98 cowardice=E2=80=99); on the c=
ontrary,=20
our defenselessness is the consequence of their cowardice.=20

Consequently the question of regaining German power is not:=20
How shall we manufacture arms? but: How shall we manufacture=20
the spirit which enables a people to bear arms? If this spirit=20
dominates a people, the will finds a thousand ways, every one=20
of which ends in a weapon! But give a coward ten pistols and if=20
attacked he will not be able to fire a single shot. And so for him=20
they are more worthless than a knotted stick for a courageous=20
man.=20

The question of regaining our people=E2=80=99s political power is=20
primarily a question of recovering our national instinct of self-=20


Recovery of Political Power=20


333=20


preservation, if for no other reason because experience shows=20
that any preparatory foreign policy, as well as any evaluation of=20
a state as such, takes its cue less from the existing weapons than=20
from a nation=E2=80=99s recognized or presumed moral capacity for re=C2=AC=
=20
sistance. A nation=E2=80=99s ability to form alliances is determined much=
=20
less by dead stores of existing arms than by the visible presence=20
of an ardent national will for self-preservation and heroic death-=20
defying courage. For an alliance is not concluded with arms but=20
with men. Thus, the English nation will have to be considered=20
the most valuable ally in the world as long as its leadership and=20
the spirit of its broad masses justify us in expecting that brutality=20
and perseverance which is determined to fight a battle once=20
begun to a victorious end, with every means and without con=C2=AC=20
sideration of time and sacrifices; and what is more, the military=20
armament existing at any given moment does not need to stand=20
in any proportion to that of other states.=20

If we understand that the resurrection of the German nation=20
represents a question of regaining our political will for self-=20
preservation, it is also clear that this cannot be done by winning=20
elements which in point of will at least are already national, but=20
only by the nationalization of the consciously anti-national=20
masses.=20

A young movement which, therefore, sets itself the goal of=20
resurrecting a German state with its own sovereignty will have=20
to direct its fight entirely to winning the broad masses. Wretched=20
as our so-called =E2=80=98 national bourgeoisie =E2=80=99 is on the whole, =
inadequate=20
as its national attitude seems, certainly from this side no serious=20
resistance is to be expected against a powerful domestic and=20
foreign policy in the future. Even if the German bourgeoisie,=20
for their well-known narrow-minded and short-sighted reasons,=20
should, as they once did toward Bismarck, maintain an obstinate=20
attitude of passive resistance in the hour of coming liberation =E2=80=94=
=20
an active resistance, in view of their recognized and proverbial=20
cowardice, is never to be feared.=20

It is different with the masses of our internationally minded=20
comrades. In their natural primitiveness, they are more inclined=20


334=20


Mein Kampf=20


to the idea of violence, and, moreover, their Jewish leadership is=20
more brutal and ruthless. They will crush any German resurrec=C2=AC=20
tion just as they once broke the backbone of the German army.=20
But above all: in this state with its parliamentary government=20
they will, thanks to their majority in numbers, not only obstruct=20
any national foreign policy, but also make impossible any higher=20
estimation of the German strength, thus making us seem unde=C2=AC=20
sirable as an ally. For not only are we ourselves aware of the=20
element of weakness lying in our fifteen million Marxists, demo=C2=AC=20
crats, pacifists, and Centrists; it is recognized even more by=20
foreign countries, which measure the value of a possible alliance=20
with us according to the weight of this burden. No one allies=20
himself with a state in which the attitude of the active part of=20
the population toward any determined foreign policy is passive,=20
to say the least.=20

To this we must add the fact that the leaderships of these=20
parties of national treason must and will be hostile to any resur=C2=AC=20
rection, out of mere instinct of self-preservation. Historically it,=20
is just not conceivable that the German people could recover its=20
former position without settling accounts with those who were=20
the cause and occasion of the unprecedented collapse which=20
struck our state. For before the judgment seat of posterity=20
November, 1918, will be evaluated, not as high treason, but as=20
treason against the fatherland. 1=20

Thus, any possibility of regaining outward German independ=C2=AC=20
ence is bound up first and foremost with the recovery of the inner=20
unity of our people=E2=80=99s will.=20

But regarded even from the purely technical point of view,=20
the idea of an outward German liberation seems senseless as long=20
as the broad masses are not also prepared to enter the service=20
of this liberating idea. From the purely military angle, every=20
officer above all will realize after a moment=E2=80=99s thought that a=20

consists of mil=C2=AC=20
itary betrayal (mutiny, desertion, betrayal of secrets to the enemy, etc.),=
=20
and is a far graver offense.=20


Winning the Broad Masses=20


335=20


foreign struggle cannot be carried on with student battalions,=20
that in addition to the brains of a people, the fists are also needed.=20
In addition, we must bear in mind that a national defense, which=20
is based only on the circles of the so-called intelligentsia, would=20
squander irreplaceable treasures. The absence of the young=20
German intelligentsia which found its death on the fields of=20
Flanders in the fall of 1914 was sorely felt later on. It was the=20
highest treasure that the German nation possessed and during=20
the War its loss could no longer be made good. Not only is it=20
impossible to carry on the struggle itself if the storming battal=C2=AC=20
ions do not find the masses of the workers in their ranks; the=20
technical preparations are also impracticable without the inner=20
unity of our national will. Especially our people, doomed to=20
languish along unarmed beneath the thousand eyes of the Ver=C2=AC=20
sailles peace treaty, can only make technical preparations for the=20
achievement of freedom and human independence if the army=20
of domestic stoolpigeons is decimated down to those whose=20
inborn lack of character permits them to betray anything and=20
everything for the well-known thirty pieces of silver. 1 For with=20
these we can deal. Unconquerable by comparison seem the mil=C2=AC=20
lions who oppose the national resurrection out of political con=C2=AC=20
viction =E2=80=94 unconquerable as long as the inner cause of their op=C2=
=AC=20
position, the international Marxist philosophy of life, is not=20
combated and torn out of their hearts and brains.=20

Regardless, therefore, from what standpoint we examine the=20
possibility of regaining our state and national independence,=20
whether from the standpoint of preparations in the sphere of=20
foreign policy, from that of technical armament or that of battle=20
itself, in every case the presupposition for everything remains the=20
previous winning of the broad masses of our people for the idea=20
of our national independence.=20

Without the recovery of our external freedom, however, any=20

1 As the thought seems too complicated to be true, I cite the German:=20

Mein Kampe=20


internal reform, even in the most favorable case, means only the=20
increase of our productivity as a colony. The surplus of all so-=20
called economic improvements falls to the benefit of our inter=C2=AC=20
national control commissions, and every social improvement at=20
best raises the productivity of our work for them. No cultural=20
advances will fall to the share of the German nation; they are=20
too contingent on the political independence and dignity of our=20
nation.=20

Thus, if a favorable solution of the German future requires a=20
national attitude on the part of the broad masses of our people,=20
this must be the highest, mightiest task of a movement whose=20
activity is not intended to exhaust itself in the satisfaction of the=20
moment, but which must examine all its commissions and omis=C2=AC=20
sions solely with a view to their presumed consequences in the=20
future.=20

Thus, by 1919 we clearly realized that, as its highest aim, the=20
new movement must first accomplish the nationalization of the=20
masses.=20

From a tactical standpoint a number of demands resulted=20
from this.=20

(1) To win the masses for a national resurrection, no social=20
sacrifice is too great.=20

Whatever economic concessions are made to our working class=20
today, they stand in no proportion to the gain for the entire=20
nation if they help to give the broad masses back to their nation.=20
Only pigheaded short-sightedness, such as is often unfortunately=20
found in our employer circles, can fail to recognize that in the=20
long run there can be no economic upswing for them and hence=20
no economic profit, unless the inner national solidarity of our=20
people is restored.=20

If during the War the German unions had ruthlessly guarded=20
the interests of the working class, if even during the War they=20
had struck a thousand times over and forced approval of the=20
demands of the workers they represented on the dividend-hungry=20
employers of those days; but if in matters of national defense=20
they had avowed their Germanism with the same fanaticism;=20


Nationalization of the Masses=20


337=20


and if with equal ruthlessness they had given to the fatherland=20
that which is the fatherland=E2=80=99s, the War would not have been lost.=
=20
And how trifling all economic concessions, even the greatest,=20
would have been, compared to the immense importance of win=C2=AC=20
ning the War!=20

Thus a movement which plans to give the German worker=20
back to the German people must clearly realize that in this ques=C2=AC=20
tion economic sacrifices are of no importance whatever as long=20
as the preservation and independence of the national economy=20
are not threatened by them.=20

(2) The national education of the broad masses can only take=20
place indirectly through a social uplift, since thus exclusively=20
can those general economic premises be created which permit the=20
individual to partake of the cultural goods of the nation.=20

(3) The nationalization of the broad masses can never be=20
achieved by half-measures, by weakly emphasizing a so-called=20
objective standpoint, but only by a ruthless and fanatically one=C2=AC=20
sided orientation toward the goal to be achieved. That is to say,=20
a people cannot be made c national=E2=80=99 in the sense understood by=20
our present-day bourgeoisie, meaning with so and so many limi=C2=AC=20
tations, but only nationalistic with the entire vehemence that is=20
inherent in the extreme. Poison is countered only by an antidote,=20
and only the shallowness of a bourgeois mind can regard the=20
middle course as the road to heaven.=20

The broad masses of a people consist neither of professors nor=20
of diplomats. The scantiness of the abstract knowledge they=20
possess directs their sentiments more to the world of feeling.=20
That is where their positive or negative attitude lies. It is re=C2=AC=20
ceptive only to an expression of force in one of these two direc=C2=AC=20
tions and never to a half-measure hovering between the two.=20
Their emotional attitude at the same time conditions their=20
extraordinary stability. Faith is harder to shake than knowledge,=20
love succumbs less to change than respect, hate is more enduring=20
than aversion, and the impetus to the mightiest upheavals on=20
this earth has at all times consisted less in a scientific knowledge=20
dominating the masses than in a fanaticism which inspired=20


338=20


Mein Kampe=20


them and sometimes in a hysteria which drove them forward.=20

Anyone who wants to win the broad masses must know the=20
key that opens the door to their heart. Its name is not objec=C2=AC=20
tivity (read weakness), but will and power.=20

(4) The soul of the people can only be won if along with carry=C2=AC=20
ing on a positive struggle for our own aims, we destroy the=20
opponent of these aims.=20

The people at all times see the proof of their own right in ruth=C2=AC=20
less attack on a foe, and to them renouncing the destruction of=20
the adversary seems like uncertainty with regard to their own=20
right if not a sign of their own unright.=20

The broad masses are only a piece of Nature and their senti=C2=AC=20
ment does not understand the mutual handshake of people who=20
claim that they want the opposite things. What they desire is=20
the victory of the stronger and the destruction of the weak or=20
his unconditional subjection.=20

The nationalization of our masses will succeed only when, aside=20
from all the positive struggle for the soul of our people, their=20
international poisoners are exterminated.=20

(5) All great questions of the day are questions of the moment=20
and represent only consequences of definite causes. Only one=20
among all of them, however, possesses causal importance, 1 and that=20
is the question of the racial preservation of the nation. In the=20
blood alone resides the strength as well as the weakness of man.=20
As long as peoples do not recognize and give heed to the impor=C2=AC=20
tance of their racial foundation, they are like men who would like=20
to teach poodles the qualities of greyhounds, failing to realize that=20
the speed of the greyhound like the docility of the poodle are not=20
learned, but are qualities inherent in the race. Peoples which=20
renounce the preservation of their racial purity renounce with it=20
the unity of their soul in all its expressions. The divided state=20
of their nature is the natural consequence of the divided state of=20
their blood, and the change in their intellectual and creative=20
force is only the effect of the change in their racial foundations.=20

Anyone who wants to free the German blood from the mani-=20

Nationalization of the Masses=20


339=20


festations and vices of today, which were originally alien to its=20
nature, will first have to redeem it from the foreign virus of these=20
manifestations.=20

Without the clearest knowledge of the racial problem and=20
hence of the Jewish problem there will never be a resurrection of=20
the German nation.=20

The racial question gives the key not only to world history,=20
but to all human culture.=20

(6) Organizing the broad masses of our people which are today=20
in the international camp into a national people=E2=80=99s community=20
does not mean renouncing the defense of justified class interests.=20
Divergent class and professional interests are not synonymous=20
with class cleavage, but are natural consequences of our eco=C2=AC=20
nomic life. Professional grouping is in no way opposed to a true=20
national community, for the latter consists in the unity of a=20
nation in all those questions which affect this nation as such.=20

The integration of an occupational group which has become=20
a class with the national community, or merely with the state,=20
is not accomplished by the lowering of higher classes but by=20
uplifting the lower classes. This process in turn can never be=20
upheld by the higher class, but only by the lower class fighting=20
for its equal rights. The present-day bourgeoisie was not organ=C2=AC=20
ized into the state by measures of the nobility, but by its own=20
energy under its own leadership.=20

The German worker will not be raised to the framework of the=20
German national community via feeble scenes of fraternization,=20
but by a conscious raising of his social and cultural situation=20
until the most serious differences may be viewed as bridged. A=20
movement which sets this development as its goal will have to=20
take its supporters primarily from this camp. 1 It may fall back=20
on the intelligentsia only in so far as the latter has completely=20
understood the goal to be achieved. This process of transforma=C2=AC=20
tion and equalization will not be completed in ten or twenty=20
years; experience shows that it comprises many generations.=20

the national community lies not in the defense of his class inter=C2=AC=20
ests, but in his international leadership and attitude which are=20
hostile to the people and the fatherland. The same unions with a=20
fanatical national leadership in political and national matters=20
would make millions of workers into the most valuable members=20
of their nation regardless of the various struggles that took place=20
over purely economic matters.=20

A movement which wants honestly to give the German worker=20
back to his people and tear him away from the international de=C2=AC=20
lusion must sharply attack a conception dominant above all in=20
employer circles, which under national community understands=20
the unresisting economic surrender of the employee to the em=C2=AC=20
ployer and which chooses to regard any attempt at safeguarding=20
even justified interests regarding the employee's economic exist=C2=AC=20
ence as an attack on the national community. Such an assertion=20
is not only untrue, but a conscious lie, because the national com=C2=AC=20
munity imposes its obligations not only on one side but also on=20
the other.=20

Just as surely as a worker sins against the spirit of a real=20
national community when, without regard for the common wel=C2=AC=20
fare and the survival of a national economy, he uses his power to=20
raise extortionate demands, an employer breaks this community=20
to the same extent when he conducts his business in an inhuman,=20
exploiting way, misuses the national labor force and makes mil=C2=AC=20
lions out of its sweat. He then has no right to designate himself=20
as national, no right to speak of a national community; no, he is=20
a selfish scoundrel who induces social unrest and provokes future=20
conflicts which whatever happens must end in harming the=20
nation.=20

Thus, the reservoir from which the young movement must=20
gather its supporters will primarily be the masses of our workers.=20
Its work will be to tear these away from the international delu=C2=AC=20
sion, to free them from their social distress, to raise them out of=20
their cultural misery and lead them to the national community as=20
a valuable, united factor, national in feeling and desire.=20

If, in the circles of the national intelligentsia, there are found=20


Nationalization of the Masses=20


341=20


men with the warmest hearts for their people and its future, im=C2=AC=20
bued with the deepest knowledge of the importance of this=20
struggle for the soul of these masses, they will be highly welcome=20
in the ranks of this movement, as a valuable spiritual backbone.=20
But winning over the bourgeois voting cattle can never be the=20
aim of this movement. If it were, it would burden itself with a=20
dead weight which by its whole nature would paralyze our power=20
to recruit from the broad masses. For regardless of the theoreti=C2=AC=20
cal beauty of the idea of leading together the broadest masses=20
from below and from above within the framework of the move=C2=AC=20
ment, there is the opposing fact that by psychological propa=C2=AC=20
gandizing of bourgeois masses in general meetings, it may be=20
possible to create moods and even to spread insight, but not to=20
do away with qualities of character or, better expressed, vices,=20
whose development and origin embrace centuries. The difference=20
with regard to the cultural level on both sides and the attitude=20
on both sides toward questions raised by economic interests is=20
at present still so great that, as soon as the intoxication of the=20
meetings has passed, it would at once manifest itself as an=20
obstacle.=20

Finally, the goal is not to undertake a restratification in the=20
camp that is national to begin with, but to win over the anti=C2=AC=20
national camp.=20

And this point of view, finally, is determining for the tactical=20
attitude of the whole movement.=20

(7) This one-sided but thereby clear position must express itself=20
in the propaganda of the movement and on the other hand in=20
turn is required on propagandist grounds.=20

If propaganda is to be effective for the movement, it must be=20
addressed to only one quarter, since otherwise, in view of the=20
difference in the intellectual training of the two camps in ques=C2=AC=20
tion, either it will not be understood by the one group, or by the=20
other it would be rejected as obvious and therefore uninteresting.=20

Even the style and the tone of its individual products cannot=20
be equally effective for two such extreme groups. If propaganda=20
renounces primitiveness of expression, it does not find its way to=20


342=20


Mein Kampf=20


the feeling of the broad masses. If, however, in word and ges=C2=AC=20
ture, it uses the masses=E2=80=99 harshness of sentiment and expression,=20
it will be rejected by the so-called intelligentsia as coarse and=20
vulgar. Among a hundred so-called speakers there are hardly=20
ten capable of speaking with equal effect today before a public=20
consisting of street-sweepers, locksmiths, sewer-cleaners, etc.,=20
and tomorrow holding a lecture with necessarily the same thought=20
content in an auditorium full of university professors and stu=C2=AC=20
dents. But among a thousand speakers there is perhaps only a=20
single one who can manage to speak to locksmiths and university=20
professors at the same time, in a form which not only is suitable=20
to the receptivity of both parties, but also influences both parties=20
with equal effect or actually lashes them into a wild storm of=20
applause. We must always bear in mind that even the most=20
beautiful idea of a sublime theory in most cases can be dissemi=C2=AC=20
nated only through the small and smallest minds. The important=20
thing is not what the genius who has created an idea has in=20
mind, but what, in what form, and with what success the proph=C2=AC=20
ets of this idea transmit it to the broad masses.=20

The strong attractive power of the Social Democracy, yes, of=20
the whole Marxist movement, rested in large part on the homo=C2=AC=20
geneity and hence one-sidedness of the public it addressed. The=20
more seemingly limited, indeed, the narrower its ideas were, the=20
more easily they were taken up and assimilated by a mass whose=20
intellectual level corresponded to the material offered.=20

Likewise for the new movement a simple and clear line thus=20
resulted:=20

Propaganda must be adjusted to the broad masses in content=20
and in form, and its soundness is to be measured exclusively by=20
its effective result.=20

In a mass meeting of all classes it is not that speaker who is=20
mentally closest to the intellectuals present who speaks best, but=20
the one who conquers the heart of the masses.=20

A member of the intelligentsia present at such a meeting, who=20
carps at the intellectual level of the speech despite the speaker=E2=80=99s=
=20
obvious effect on the lower strata he has set out to conquer,=20


Nationalization oe the Masses=20


343=20


proves the complete incapacity of his thinking and the worthless=C2=AC=20
ness of his person for the young movement. It can use only that=20
intellectual who comprehends the task and goal of the movement=20
to such an extent that he has learned to judge the activity of=20
propaganda according to its success and not according to the=20
impressions which it leaves behind in himself. For propaganda is=20
not intended to provide entertainment for people who are=20
national-minded to begin with, but to win the enemies of our=20
nationality, in so far as they are of our blood.=20

In general those trends of thought which I have briefly summed=20
up under the heading of war propaganda should be determining=20
and decisive for our movement in the manner and execution of its=20
own enlightenment work.=20

That it was right was demonstrated by its success.=20

(8) The goal of a political reform movement will never be=20
reached by enlightenment work or by influencing ruling circles,=20
but only by the achievement of political power. Every world-=20
moving idea has not only the right, but also the duty, of securing,=20
those means which make possible the execution of its ideas.=20
Success is the one earthly judge concerning the right or wrong of=20
such an effort, and under success we must not understand, as=20
in the year 1918, the achievement of power in itself, but an exer=C2=AC=20
cise of that power that will benefit the nation. Thus, a coup=20
d=E2=80=99etat must not be regarded as successful if, as senseless state=E2=
=80=99s=20
attorneys in Germany think today, the revolutionaries have suc=C2=AC=20
ceeded in possessing themselves of the state power, but only if,=20
by the realization of the purposes and aims underlying such a=20
revolutionary action, more benefit accrues to the nation than=20
under the past regime. Something which cannot very well be=20
claimed for the German revolution, as the gangster job of autumn,=20
1918, calls itself.=20

If the achievement of political power constitutes the precondi=C2=AC=20
tion for the practical execution of reform purposes, the move=C2=AC=20
ment with reform purposes must from the first day of its existence=20
feel itself a movement of the masses and not a literary tea-club=20
or a shopkeepers=E2=80=99 bowling society.=20


344=20


Mein Kampe=20


(9) The young movement is in its nature and inner organiza=C2=AC=20
tion anti-parliamentarian; that is, it rejects, in general and in=20
its own inner structure, a principle of majority rule in which the=20
leader is degraded to the level of a mere executant of other people=E2=80=
=99s=20
will and opinion. In little as well as big things, the movement ad=C2=AC=20
vocates the principle of a Germanic democracy: the leader is=20
elected, but then enjoys unconditional authority.=20

The practical consequences of this principle in the movement=20
are the following:=20

The first chairman of a local group is elected, but then he is=20
the responsible leader of the local group. All committees are=20
subordinate to him and not, conversely, he to a committee.=20
There are no electoral committees, but only committees for=20
work. The responsible leader, the first chairman, organizes the=20
work. The first principle applies to the next higher organization,=20
the precinct, the district or county. The leader is always elected,=20
but thereby he is vested with unlimited powers and authority.=20
And, finally, the same applies to the leadership of the whole=20
party. The chairman is elected, but he is the exclusive leader of=20
the movement. 1 All committees are subordinate to him and not=20

1 This is one of the few passages the sense of which has been radically=20
changed in the second edition. By the time of the appearance of the second=
=20
edition, Hitler had emerged victorious from the factional conflicts within =
the=20
party. His authority was now uncontested. In the second edition the pas=C2=
=AC=20
sage reads:=20

=E2=80=98The young movement is in its nature and inner organization anti-pa=
rlia=C2=AC=20
mentarian; that is, it rejects in general and in its own inner structure, a=
=20
principle of majority rule in which the leader is degraded to the level of =
a=20
mere executant of other people=E2=80=99s will and opinion. In little as wel=
l as big=20
things, the movement advocates the principle of unconditional authority of=
=20
the leader, coupled with the highest responsibility.=20

=E2=80=98The practical consequences of this principle in the movement are t=
he=20
following:=20

=E2=80=98The first chairman of a local group is appointed by the next highe=
st=20
leader; he is the responsible leader of the local group. All committees are=
=20
subordinate to him and not, conversely, he to a committee. There are no=20
electoral committees, but only committees for work. The responsible=20
leader, the first chairman, organizes the work. The first principle applies=
 to=20


Neither Monarchist Nor Republican 345=20

he to the committees. He makes the decisions and hence bears the=20
responsibility on his shoulders. Members of the movement are=20
free to call him to account before the forum of a new election,=20
to divest him of his office in so far as he has infringed on the=20
principles of the movement or served its interests badly. His=20
place is then taken by an abler, new man, enjoying, however,=20
the same authority and the same responsibility.=20

It is one of the highest tasks of the movement to make this=20
principle determining, not only within its own ranks, but for=20
the entire state.=20

Any man who wants to be leader bears, along with the highest=20
unlimited authority, also the ultimate and heaviest responsi=C2=AC=20
bility.=20

Anyone who is not equal to this or is too cowardly to bear=20
the consequences of his acts is not fit to be leader; only the hero=20
is cut out for this.=20

The progress and culture of humanity are not a product of the=20
majority, but rest exclusively on the genius and energy of the=20
personality.=20

To cultivate the personality and establish it in its rights is=20
one of the prerequisites for recovering the greatness and power=20
of our nationality.=20

Hence the movement is anti-parliamentarian, and even its=20
participation in a parliamentary institution can only imply activ=C2=AC=20
ity for its destruction, for eliminating an institution in which=20
we must see one of the gravest symptoms of mankind=E2=80=99s decay.=20

(10) The movement decisively rejects any position on questions=20
which either lie outside the frame of its political work or, being=20
not of basic importance, are irrelevant for it. Its task is not a=20
religious reformation, but a political reorganization of our people.=20
In both religious denominations it sees equally valuable pillars=20

the next higher organization, the precinct, the district or county. The=20
leader is always appointed from above and at the same time vested with=20
unlimited powers and authority. Only the leader of the whole party is=20
elected, in a general membership meeting compatible with the laws govern=C2=
=AC=20
ing associations. But he is the exclusive leader of the movement.=E2=80=99=
=20


346=20


Mein Kampf=20


for the existence of our people and therefore combats those parties=20
which want to degrade this foundation of an ethical, moral, and=20
religious consolidation of our national body to the level of an=20
instrument of their party interests.=20

The movement finally sees its task, not in the restoration of a=20
definite state form and in the struggle against another, but in=20
the creation of those basic foundations without which neither=20
republic nor monarchy can endure for any length of time. Its=20
mission lies not in the foundation of a monarchy or in the rein=C2=AC=20
forcement of a republic, but in the creation of a Germanic state.=20

The question of the outward shaping of this state, its crowning,=20
so to speak, is not of basic importance, but is determined only=20
by questions of practical expediency.=20

For a people that has once understood the great problems and=20
tasks of its existence, the questions of outward formalities wiP=20
no longer lead to inner struggle.=20

(11) The question of the movement=E2=80=99s inner organization is one=20
of expediency and not of principle.=20

The best organization is not that which inserts the greatest,=20
but that which inserts the smallest, intermediary apparatus be=C2=AC=20
tween the leadership of a movement and its individual adherents.=20
For the function of organization is the transmission of a definite=20
idea =E2=80=94 which always first arises from the brain of an individual=20
=E2=80=94 to a larger body of men and the supervision of its realization.=
=20

Hence organization is in all things only a necessary evil. In=20
the best case it is a means to an end, in the worst case an end in=20
itself.=20

Since the world produces more mechanical than ideal natures,=20
the forms of organization are usually created more easily than=20
ideas as such.=20

The practical development of every idea striving for realiza=C2=AC=20
tion in this world, particularly of one possessing a reform char=C2=AC=20
acter, is in its broad outlines as follows:=20

Some idea of genius arises in the brain of a man who feels=20
called upon to transmit his knowledge to the rest of humanity.=20
He preaches his view and gradually wins a certain circle of ad-=20


Authority or the Central Ofeice=20


347=20


herents. This process of the direct and personal transmittance=20
of a man=E2=80=99s ideas to the rest of his fellow men 1 is the most ideal=
=20
and natural. With the rising increase in the adherents of the new=20
doctrine, it gradually becomes impossible for the exponent of=20
the idea to go on exerting a personal, direct influence on the=20
innumerable supporters, to lead and direct them. Proportion=C2=AC=20
ately as, in consequence of the growth of the community, the=20
direct and shortest communication is excluded, the necessity of=20
a connecting organization arises: thus, the ideal condition is=20
ended and is replaced by the necessary evil of organization.=20
Little sub-groups are formed which in the political movement,=20
for example, call themselves local groups and constitute the=20
germ-cells of the future organization.=20

If the unity of the doctrine is not to be lost, however, this sub=C2=AC=20
division must not take place until the authority of the spiritual=20
founder and of the school trained by him can be regarded as=20
unconditional. The geo-political significance of a focal center=20
in a movement cannot be overemphasized. Only the presence of=20
such a place, exerting the magic spell of a Mecca or a Rome, can=20
in the long run give the movement a force which is based on=20
inner unity and the recognition of a summit representing this=20
unity.=20

Thus, in forming the first organizational germ-cells we must=20
never lose sight of the necessity, not only of preserving the im=C2=AC=20
portance of the original local source of the idea, but of making it=20
paramount. This intensification of the ideal, moral, and factual=20
immensity of the movement=E2=80=99s point of origin and direction=20
must take place in exact proportion as the movement=E2=80=99s germ-=20
cells, which have now become innumerable, demand new links in=20
the shape of organizational forms.=20

For, as the increasing number of individual adherents makes=20
it impossible to continue direct communication with them for=20
the formation of the lowest bodies, the ultimate innumerable=20
increase 2 of these lowest organizational forms compels in turn=20

11 die andere Mitwelt . 1=20

21 die zahllose Vermehrungd=20


348=20


Mein Kampe=20


creation of higher associations which politically can be desig=C2=AC=20
nated roughly as county or district groups.=20

Easy as it still may be to maintain the authority of the original=20
center toward the lowest local groups, it will be equally difficult to=20
maintain this position toward the higher organizational forms=20
which now arise. But this is the precondition for the unified=20
existence of the movement and hence for carrying out an idea.=20

If, finally, these larger intermediary divisions are also com=C2=AC=20
bined into new organizational forms, the difficulty is further in=C2=AC=20
creased of safeguarding, even toward them, the unconditional=20
leading character of the original founding site, its school, etc.=20

Therefore, the mechanical forms of an organization may only=20
be developed to the degree in which the spiritual ideal authority=20
of a center seems unconditionally secured. In political forma=C2=AC=20
tions this guaranty can often seem provided only by practical=20
power.=20

From this the following directives for the inner structure of=20
the movement resulted:=20

(a) Concentration for the time being of all activity in a single=20
place: Munich. Training of a community of unconditionally re=C2=AC=20
liable supporters and development of a school for the subse=C2=AC=20
quent dissemination of the idea. Acquisition of the necessary=20
authority for the future by the greatest possible visible suc=C2=AC=20
cesses in this one place.=20

To make the movement and its leaders known, it was neces=C2=AC=20
sary, not only to shake the belief in the invincibility of the=20
Marxist doctrine in one place for all to see, but to demonstrate=20
the possibility of an opposing movement.=20

(b) Formation of local groups only when the authority of the=20
central leadership in Munich may be regarded as unquestionably=20
recognized.=20

(c) Likewise the formation of district, county, or provincial=20
groups depends, not only on the need for them, but also on cer=C2=AC=20
tainty that an unconditional recognition of the center has been=20
achieved.=20

Furthermore, the creation of organizational forms is dependent=20


Inner Structure or the Movement=20


349=20


on the men who are available and can be considered as leaders.=20

This may occur in two ways:=20

(a) The movement disposes of the necessary financial means=20
for the training and schooling of minds capable of future leader=C2=AC=20
ship. It then distributes the material thus acquired systemati=C2=AC=20
cally according to criteria of tactical and other expediency.=20

This way is the easier and quicker; however, it demands great=20
financial means, since this leader material is only able to work=20
for the movement when pffid.=20

(b) The movement, owing to the lack of financial means, is=20
not in a position to appoint official leaders, but for the present=20
must depend on honorary officers.=20

This way is the slower and more difficult.=20

Under certain circumstances the leadership of a movement=20
must let large territories lie fallow, unless there emerges from the=20
adherents a man able and willing to put himself at the disposal=20
of the leadership, and organize and lead the movement in the=20
district in question.=20

It may happen that in large territories there will be no one, in=20
other places, however, two or even three almost equally capable.=20
The difficulty that lies in such a development is great and can=20
only be overcome in the course of years.=20

The prerequisite for the creation of an organizational form is=20
and remains the man necessary for its leadership.=20

As worthless as an army in all its organizational forms is with=C2=AC=20
out officers, equally worthless is a political organization without=20
the suitable leader.=20

Not founding a local group is more useful to the movement=20
when a suitable leader personality is lacking than to have its=20
organization miscarry due to the absence of a leader to direct=20
and drive it forward.=20

Leadership itself requires not only will but also ability, and=20
a greater importance must be attached to will and energy than to=20
intelligence as such, and most valuable of all is a combination of=20
ability, determination, and perseverance.=20

(12) The future of a movement is conditioned bv the fanati-=20


350=20


Mein Kampf=20


cism, yes, the intolerance, with which its adherents uphold it as=20
the sole correct movement, and push it past other formations=20
of a similar sort.=20

It is the greatest error to believe that the strength of a move=C2=AC=20
ment increases through a union with another of similar character.=20
It is true that every enlargement of this kind at first means an=20
increase in outward dimensions, which to the eyes of superficial=20
observers means power; in truth, however, it only takes over the=20
germs of an inner weakening that will later become effective.=20

For whatever can be said about the like character of two=20
movements, in reality it is never present. For otherwise there=20
would actually be not two movements but one. And regardless=20
wherein the differences lie =E2=80=94 even if they consisted only in the=20
varying abilities of the leadership =E2=80=94 they exist. But the natural=
=20
law of all development demands, not the coupling of two forma=C2=AC=20
tions which are simply not alike, but the victory of the stronger=20
and the cultivation of the victor=E2=80=99s force and strength made=20
possible alone by the resultant struggle.=20

Through the union of two more or less equal political party=20
formations momentary advantages may arise, but in the long=20
run any success won in this way is the cause of inner weaknesses=20
which appear later.=20

The greatness of a movement is exclusively guaranteed by=20
the unrestricted development of its inner strength and its steady=20
growth up to the final victory over all competitors.=20

Yes, we can say that its strength and hence the justification of=20
its existence increases only so long as it recognizes the principle=20
of struggle as the premise of its development, and that it has=20
passed the high point of its strength in the moment when com=C2=AC=20
plete victory inclines to its side.=20

Therefore, it is only profitable for a movement to strive for=20
this victory in a form which does not lead to an early momentary=20
success, but which in a long struggle occasioned by absolute in=C2=AC=20
tolerance also provides long growth.=20

Movements which increase only by the so-called fusion of=20
similar formations, thus owing their strength to compromises, are=20


Education for Struggle=20


351=20


like hothouse plants. They shoot up, but they lack the strength=20
to defy the centuries and withstand heavy storms.=20

The greatness of every mighty organization embodying an idea=20
in this world lies in the religious fanaticism and intolerance with=20
which, fanatically convinced of its own right, it intolerantly im=C2=AC=20
poses its will against all others. If an idea in itself is sound and,=20
thus armed, takes up a struggle on this earth, it is unconquerable=20
and every persecution will only add to its inner strength.=20

The greatness of Christianity did not lie in attempted negotia=C2=AC=20
tions for compromise with any similar philosophical opinions in=20
the ancient world, but in its inexorable fanaticism in preaching=20
and fighting for its own doctrine.=20

The apparent head start which movements achieve by fusions=20
is amply caught up with by the steady increase in the strength of=20
a doctrine and organization that remain independent and fight=20
their own fight.=20

(13) On principle the movement must so educate its members=20
that they do not view the struggle as something idly cooked up,=20
but as the thing that they themselves are striving for. 1 Therefore,=20
they must not fear the hostility of their enemies, but must feel=20
that it is the presupposition for their own right to exist. They=20
must not shun the hatred of the enemies of our nationality and=20
our philosophy and its manifestations; they must long for them.=20
And among the manifestations of this hate are lies and slander.=20

Any man who is not attacked in the Jewish newspapers, not=20

It must, over and over again, be pointed out to the adherents=20
of the movement and in a broader sense to the whole people that=20

Anyone who picks up a Jewish newspaper in the morning and=20
does not see himself slandered in it has not made profitable use=20
of the previous day; for if he had, he would be persecuted, reviled,=20
slandered, abused, befouled. And only the man who combats this=20
mortal enemy of our nation and of all Aryan humanity and cul=C2=AC=20

not the mechanical but the cultural and creative element. No=20
more than a famous master can be replaced and another take=20

the great soldier, be replaced. For their activity lies always in=20
the province of art. It is not mechanically trained, but inborn=20

The greatest revolutionary changes and achievements of this=20
earth, its greatest cultural accomplishments, the immortal deeds=20
in the field of statesmanship, etc., are forever inseparably bound=20
up with a name and are represented by it. To renounce doing=20
homage to a great spirit means the loss of an immense strength=20
which emanates from the names of all great men and women.=20

that they are idolatrously admired. He attempts only to repre=C2=AC=20

As soon as a people becomes so cowardly that it succumbs to=20
this Jewish arrogance and effrontery, it renounces the mightiest=20

In the first period of our movement=E2=80=99s development we suf-=20
ered from nothing so much as from the insignificance, the un=C2=AC=20
knownness of our names, which in themselves made our success=20
questionable. The hardest thing in this first period, when often=20
only six, seven, or eight heads met together, to use the words of=20
an opponent, was to arouse and preserve in this tiny circle faith=20
in the mighty future of the movement.=20

Consider that six or seven men, all nameless poor devils, had=20
joined together with the intention of forming a movement, hop=C2=AC=20
ing to succeed =E2=80=94 where the powerful great mass parties had=20
hitherto failed =E2=80=94 in restoring a German Reich of greater power=20
and glory. If people had attacked us in those days, yes, even if=20
they had laughed at us, in both cases we should have been happy. '=20
For the oppressive thing was neither the one nor the other; it=20
was the complete lack of attention we found in those days. 1=20

When I entered the circle of these few men, there could be no=20
question of a party or a movement. I have already described my=20

1 Second edition adds: =E2=80=98from which I suffered most/=20


354=20


Mein Kampf=20


impressions regarding my first meeting with this little formation.=20
In the weeks that followed, I had time and occasion to study this=20
so-called =E2=80=98party=E2=80=99 which at first looked so impossible. And,=
 by=20
God, the picture was depressing and discouraging. There was=20
nothing here, really positively nothing. The name of a party=20
whose committee constituted practically the whole membership,=20
which, whether we liked it or not, was exactly what it was trying=20
to combat, a parliament on a small scale. Here, too, the vote=20
ruled; if big parliaments yelled their throats hoarse for months=20
at a time, it was about important problems at least, but in this=20
little circle the answer to a safely arrived letter let loose an=20
interminable argument!=20

The public, of course, knew nothing at all about this. Not a=20
soul in Munich knew the party even by name, except for its few=20
supporters and their few friends.=20

Every Wednesday a so-called committee meeting took place=20
in a Munich cafe, and once a week an evening lecture. Since the=20
whole membership of the =E2=80=98 movement =E2=80=99 was at first represent=
ed in=20
the committee, the faces of course were always the same. Now=20
the task was at last to burst the bonds of the small circle, to win=20
new supporters, but above all to make the name of the movement=20
known at any price.=20

In this we used the following technique:=20

Every month, and later every two weeks, we tried to hold a=20
=E2=80=98meeting.=E2=80=99 The invitations to it were written on the typewr=
iter or=20
sometimes by hand on slips of paper and the first few times were=20
distributed, or handed out, 1 by us personally. Each one of us=20
turned to the circle of his friends, and tried to induce someone=20
or other to attend one of these affairs.=20

The result was miserable.=20

I still remember how I myself in this first period once distrib=C2=AC=20
uted about eighty of these slips of paper, and how in the evening=20
we sat waiting for the masses who were expected to appear.=20

An hour late, the =E2=80=98chairman=E2=80=99 finally had to open the =E2=80=
=98meeting.=E2=80=99=20
We were again seven men, the old seven.=20

The First Meeting=20


355=20


We changed over to having the invitation slips written on a=20
machine and mimeographed in a Munich stationery store. The=20
result' at the next meeting was a few more listeners. Thus the=20
number rose slowly from eleven to thirteen, finally to seventeen,=20
to twenty-three, to thirty-four listeners.=20

By little collections among us poor devils the funds were=20
raised with which at last to advertise the meeting by notices in=20
the then independent Miinchener Beobachter in Munich. And=20
this time the success was positively amazing. We had organized=20
the meeting in the Munich Hofbrauhauskeller (not to be confused=20
with the Munich Hofbrauhaus-Festsaal), a little room with a=20
capacity of barely one hundred and thirty people. To me per=C2=AC=20
sonally the room seemed like a big hall and each of us was worried=20
whether we would succeed in filling this =E2=80=98 mighty =E2=80=99 edifice=
 with=20
people.=20

At seven o=E2=80=99clock one hundred and eleven people were present=20
and the meeting was opened.=20

A Munich professor made the main speech, and I, for the first=20
time, in public, was to speak second.=20

In the eyes of Herr Harrer, then first chairman of the party,=20
the affair seemed a great adventure. This gentleman, who was=20
certainly otherwise honest, just happened to be convinced that=20
I might be capable of doing certain things, but not of speaking.=20
And even in the time that followed he could not be dissuaded=20
from this opinion.=20

Things turned out differently. In this first meeting that could=20
be called public I had been granted twenty minutes=E2=80=99 speaking=20
time.=20

I spoke for thirty minutes, and what before I had simply felt=20
within me, without in any way knowing it, was now proved by=20
reality: I could speak! After thirty minutes the people in the=20
small room were electrified and the enthusiasm was first expressed=20
by the fact that my appeal to the self-sacrifice of those present=20
led to the donation of three hundred marks. This relieved us of=20
a great worry. For at this time the financial stringency was so=20
great that we were not even in a position to have slogans printed=20


356=20


Mein Kampe=20


for the movement, or even distribute leaflets. Now the founda=C2=AC=20
tion was laid for a little fund from which at least our barest needs=20
and most urgent necessities could be defrayed. But in another=20
respect as well, the success of this first larger meeting was con=C2=AC=20
siderable.=20

At that time I had begun to bring a number of fresh young=20
forces into the committee. During my many years in the army I=20
had come to know a great number of faithful comrades who now=20
slowly, on the basis of my persuasion, began to enter the move=C2=AC=20
ment. They were all energetic young people, accustomed to=20
discipline, and from their period of service raised in the principle:=20
nothing at all is impossible, everything can be done if you only=20
want it.=20

How necessary such a transfusion of new blood was, I myself=20
could recognize after only a few weeks of collaboration.=20

Herr Harrer, then first chairman of the party, was really a=20
journalist and as such he was certainly widely educated. But=20
for a party leader he had one exceedingly serious drawback: he=20
was no speaker for the masses. As scrupulously conscientious and=20
precise as his work in itself was, it nevertheless lacked =E2=80=94 perhaps=
=20
because of this very lack of a great oratorical gift =E2=80=94 the great=20
sweep. Herr Drexler, then chairman of the Munich local group,=20
was a simple worker, likewise not very significant as a speaker,=20
and moreover he was no soldier. He had not served in the army,=20
even during the War he had not been a soldier, so that feeble and=20
uncertain as he was in his whole nature, he lacked the only=20
schooling which was capable of turning uncertain and soft natures=20
into men. Thus both men were not made of stuff which would=20
have enabled them not only to bear in their hearts fanatical faith=20
in the victory of a movement, but also with indomitable energy=20
and will, and if necessary with brutal ruthlessness, to sweep aside=20
any obstacles which might stand in the path of the rising new=20
idea. For this only beings were fitted in whom spirit and body=20
had acquired those military virtues which can perhaps best be=20
described as follows: swift as greyhounds, tough as leather, and=20
hard as Krupp steel.=20

Soldiers as the Care oe the Movement=20

At that time I myself was still a soldier. My exterior and=20
interior had been whetted and hardened for well-nigh six years,=20
so that at first I must have seemed strange in this circle. I, too,=20
had forgotten how to say: =E2=80=98that=E2=80=99s impossible,=E2=80=99 or =
=E2=80=98it won=E2=80=99t work=E2=80=99;=20
=E2=80=98we can=E2=80=99t risk that,=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98that is too dangerou=
s,=E2=80=99 etc.=20

For of course the business was dangerous. Little attention as=20
the Reds paid to one of your bourgeois gossip clubs whose inner=20
innocence and hence harmlessness for themselves they knew better=20
than its own members, they were determined to use every means=20
to get rid of a movement which did seem dangerous to them.=20
Their most effective method in such cases has at all times been=20
terror or violence.=20

In the year 1920, in many regions of Germany, a national=20
meeting that dared to address its appeal to the broad masses and=20
publicly invite attendance was simply impossible. The partici=C2=AC=20
pants in such a meeting were dispersed and driven away with=20
bleeding heads. Such an accomplishment, to be sure, did not=20
require much skill: for after all the biggest so-called bourgeois=20
mass meeting would scatter at the sight of a dozen Communists=20
like hares running from a hound.=20

Most loathsome to the Marxist deceivers of the people was=20
inevitably a movement whose explicit aim was the winning of=20
those masses which had hitherto stood exclusively in the service=20
of the international Marxist Jewish stock exchange parties. The=20
very name of =E2=80=98 German Workers=E2=80=99 Party=E2=80=99 had the effec=
t of goading=20
them. Thus one could easily imagine that on the first suitable=20
occasion the conflict would begin with the Marxist inciters who=20
were then still drunk with victory.=20

In the small circle that the movement then was a certain fear=20
of such a fight prevailed. The members wanted to appear in=20
public as little as possible, for fear of being beaten up. In their=20
mind=E2=80=99s eye they already saw the first great meeting smashed and=20
the movement finished for good. I had a hard time putting for=C2=AC=20
ward my opinion that we must not dodge this struggle, but pre=C2=AC=20
pare for it, and for this reason acquire the armament which alone=20
offers protection against violence. Terror is not broken by the=20


=E2=9C=93=20


358=20


Mein Kampf=20


mind, but by terror. The success of the first meeting strengthened=20
my position in this respect. We gained courage for a second=20
meeting on a somewhat larger scale.=20

About October, 1919, the second, larger meeting took place=20
in the Eberlbraukefler. Topic: Brest-Litovsk and Versailles.=20
Four gentlemen appeared as speakers. I myself spoke for almost=20
an hour and the success was greater than at the first rally. The=20
audience had risen to more than one hundred and thirty. An=20
attempted disturbance was at once nipped in the bud by my com=C2=AC=20
rades. The disturbers flew down the stairs with gashed heads.=20

Two weeks later another meeting took place in the same hall.=20
The attendance had risen to over one hundred and seventy and=20
the room was well filled. I had spoken again, and again the=20
success was greater than at the previous meeting.=20

I pressed for a larger hall. At length we found one at the other=20
end of town in the c Deutsches Reich * on Dachauer Strasse.=20
The first meeting in the new hall was not so well attended as the=20
previous one: barely one hundred and forty persons. In the com=C2=AC=20
mittee, hopes began to sink and the eternal doubters felt that=20
the excessive repetition of our =E2=80=98 demonstrations =E2=80=99 had to b=
e con=C2=AC=20
sidered the cause of the bad attendance. There were violent=20
arguments in which I upheld the view that a city of seven hun=C2=AC=20
dred thousand inhabitants could stand not one meeting every=20
two weeks, but ten every week, that we must not let ourselves=20
be misled by failures, that the road we had taken was the right=20
one, and that sooner or later, with steady perseverance, success=20
was bound to come. All in all, this whole period of winter=20
1919-20 was a single struggle to strengthen confidence in the=20
victorious might of the young movement and raise it to that=20
fanaticism of faith which can move mountains.=20

The next meeting in the same hall showed me to be right. The=20
attendance had risen to over two hundred; the public as well as=20
financial success was brilliant.=20

I urged immediate preparations for another meeting. It took=20
place barely two weeks later and the audience rose to over two=20
hundred and seventy heads.=20


Giving the Movement Its Inner Form 359=20

Two weeks later, for the seventh time, we called together the=20
supporters and friends of the new movement and the same hall=20
could barely hold the people who had grown to over four=20
hundred.=20

It was at this time that the young movement received its inner=20
form. In the small circle there were sometimes more or less vio=C2=AC=20
lent disputes. Various quarters =E2=80=94 then as today =E2=80=94 carped at=
=20
designating the young movement as a party. In such a concep=C2=AC=20
tion I have always seen proof of the critics=E2=80=99 practical incompe=C2=
=AC=20
tence and intellectual smallness. They were and always are the=20
men who cannot distinguish externals from essentials, and who=20
try to estimate the value of a movement according to the most=20
bombastic-sounding titles, most of which, sad to say, the vocabu=C2=AC=20
lary of our forefathers must provide.=20

It was hard, at that time, to make it clear to people that every=20
movement, as long as it has not achieved the victory of its ideas,=20
hence its goal, is a party even if it assumes a thousand different=20
names.=20

If any man wants to put into practical effect a bold idea whose=20
realization seems useful in the interests of his fellow men, he=20
will first of all have to seek supporters who are ready to fight for=20
his intentions. And if this intention consists only in destroying=20
the existing parties, of ending the fragmentation, the exponents=20
of this view and propagators of this determination are themselves=20
a party, as long as this goal has not been achieved. It is hair=C2=AC=20
splitting and shadow-boxing when some antiquated folkish the=C2=AC=20
oretician, whose practical successes stand in inverse proportion=20
to his wisdom, imagines that he can change the party character=20
which every young movement possesses by changing this term.=20

On the contrary.=20

If anything is unfolkish, it is this tossing around of old Ger=C2=AC=20
manic expressions which neither fit into the present period nor=20
represent anything definite, but can easily lead to seeing the sig=C2=AC=20
nificance of a movement in its outward vocabulary. This is a=20
real menace which today can be observed on countless occasions.=20

Altogether then, and also in the period that followed, I had to=20


360=20


Mein Kampf=20


warn again and again against those deutschvolkisch 1 wandering=20
scholars whose positive accomplishment is always practically nil,=20
but whose conceit can scarcely be excelled. The young movement=20
had and still has to guard itself against an influx of people whose=20
sole recommendation for the most part lies in their declaration=20
that they have fought for thirty and even forty years for the=20
same idea. Anyone who fights for forty years for a so-called idea=20
without being able to bring about even the slightest success,=20
in fact, without having prevented the victory of the opposite,=20
has, with forty years of activity, provided proof of his own in=C2=AC=20
capacity. The danger above all lies in the fact that such natures=20
do not want to fit into the movement as links, but keep shooting=20
off their mouths about leading circles in which alone, on the=20
strength of their age-old activity, they can see a suitable place=20
for further activity. But woe betide if a young movement is=20
surrended to the mercies of such people. No more than a busi=C2=AC=20
ness man who in forty years of activity has steadily run a big=20
business into the ground is fitted to be the founder of a new one,=20
is a folkish Methuselah, who in exactly the same time has gummed=20
up and petrified a great idea, fit for the leadership of a new,=20
young movement!=20

Besides, only a fragment of all these people come into the new=20
movement to serve it, but in most cases, under its protection or=20

1 The Deutschvolkische Partei was founded in 1914 by a union of various=20
anti-Semitic groups. After the revolution of November, 1918, it dissolved=
=20
into the Deutschnationale Volkspartei (German National=E2=80=99People=E2=80=
=99s Party)=20
which was the strongest party of the extreme Right under the Weimar=20
Republic, until overshadowed by the National Socialists. At the same time=
=20
a Deutschvolkischer Bund was founded, which in 1922 assumed the name=20
of Deutschvolkischer Schulz- und Trutzbund and was suppressed after the=20
murder of Rathenau. A Deutschvolkische Freiheitspartei was also founded=20
in 1922, but soon merged with the Nazis. Finally, there was a Deutschvol-=
=20
kische Freiheitsbewegung under the leadership of Ludendorff, which broke=20
away from the Nazis in 1925.=20

Hitler=E2=80=99s attacks here are directed against all his Rightist competi=
tors,=20
those belonging to rival movements and those struggling for leadership=20
within his own movement.=20


Tin Swords and Dressed Bearskins=20


361=20


through the possibilities it offers, to warm over their old cabbage.=20

They do not want to benefit the idea of the new doctrine, they=20
only expect it to give them a chance to make humanity miserable=20
with their own ideas. For what kind of ideas they often are, it=20
is hard to tell.=20

The characteristic thing about these people is that they rave=20
about old Germanic heroism, about dim prehistory, stone axes,=20
spear and shield, but in reality are the greatest cowards that=20
can be imagined. For the same people who brandish scholarly=20
imitations of old German tin swords, and wear a dressed bear=C2=AC=20
skin with bulks horns over their bearded heads, preach for the=20
present nothing but struggle with spiritual weapons, and run=20
away as fast as they can from every Communist blackjack.=20
Posterity will have little occasion to glorify their own heroic=20
existence in a new epic.=20

I came to know these people too well not to feel the profound-=20
est disgust at their miserable play-acting. But they make a ridicu=C2=AC=20
lous impression on the broad masses, and the Jew has every=20
reason to spare these folkish comedians, even to prefer them to=20
the true fighters for a coming German state. With all this, these=20
people are boundlessly conceited; despite all the proofs of their=20
complete incompetence, they claim to know everything better=20
and become a real plague for all straightforward and honest=20
fighters to whom heroism seems worth honoring, not only in the=20
past, but who also endeavor to give posterity a similar picture=20
by their own actions.=20

And often it can be distinguished only with difficulty which of=20
these people act out of inner stupidity or incompetence and=20
which only pretend to for certain reasons. Especially with the=20
so-called religious reformers on an old Germanic basis, I always=20
have the feeling that they were sent by those powers which do=20
not want the resurrection of our people. For their whole activity=20
leads the people away from the common struggle against the=20
common enemy, the Jew, and instead lets them waste their=20
strength on inner religious squabbles as senseless as they are=20
disastrous. For these very reasons the establishment of a strong=20


362=20


Mein Kampf=20


central power implying the unconditional authority of a leader=C2=AC=20
ship is necessary in the movement. By it alone can such ruinous=20
elements be squelched. And for this reason the greatest enemies=20
of a uniform, strictly led and conducted movement are to be=20
found in the circles of these folkish wandering Jews. In the move=C2=AC=20
ment they hate the power that checks their mischief.=20

Not for nothing did the young movement establish a definite=20
program in which it did not use the word =E2=80=98 folkish. =E2=80=99 The c=
oncept=20
folkish, in view of its conceptual boundlessness, is no possible=20
basis for a movement and offers no standard for membership in=20
one. The more indefinable this concept is in practice, the more=20
and broader interpretations it permits, the greater becomes the=20
possibility of invoking its authority. The insertion of such an=20
indefinable and variously interpretable concept into the politi=C2=AC=20
cal struggle leads to the destruction of any strict fighting soli=C2=AC=20
darity, since the latter does not permit leaving to the individual=20
the definition of his faith and will.=20

And it is disgraceful to see all the people who run around today=20
with the word =E2=80=98 folkish' on their caps and how many have their=20
own interpretation of this concept. A Bavarian professor by the=20
name of Bayer, 1 a famous fighter with spiritual weapons, rich=20
in equally spiritual marches on Berlin, thinks that the concept=20
folkish consists only in a monarchistic attitude. This learned=20
mind, however, has thus far forgotten to give a closer explana=C2=AC=20
tion of the identity of our German monarchs of the past with the=20
folkish opinion of today. And I fear that in this the gentleman=20
would not easily succeed. For anything less folkish than most of=20
the Germanic monarchic state formations can hardly be imag=C2=AC=20
ined. If this were not so, they would never have disappeared, or=20
their disappearance would offer proof of the unsoundness of the=20
folkish outlook.=20

And so everyone shoots off his mouth about this concept as he=20
happens to understand it. As a basis for a movement of political=20

struggle, such a multiplicity of opinions is out of the question.=20

I shah not even speak of the unworldliness of these folkish=20
Saint Johns of the twentieth century or their ignorance of the=20
popular soul. It is sufficiently illustrated by the ridicule with=20
which they are treated by the Left, which lets them talk and=20
laughs at them.=20

Anyone in this world who does not succeed in being hated by=20
his adversaries does not seem to me to be worth much as a=20
friend. And thus the friendship of these people for our young=20
movement was not only worthless, but solely and always harm=C2=AC=20
ful, and it was also the main reason why, first of all, we chose=20
the name of =E2=80=98party=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 we had grounds for hoping tha=
t by this=20
alone a whole swarm of these folkish sleepwalkers would be=20
frightened away from us =E2=80=94 and why in the second place we=20
termed ourselves National Socialist German Workers=E2=80=99 Party.=20

The first expression kept away the antiquity enthusiasts, the=20
big-mouths and superficial proverb-makers of the so-called=20
=E2=80=98folkish idea,=E2=80=99 and the second freed us from the entire hos=

knights of the =E2=80=98spiritual sword,=E2=80=99 all the poor wretches who=
 wield=20
the =E2=80=98spiritual weapon=E2=80=99 as a protecting shield to hide their=
 actual=20
cowardice.=20

It goes without saying that in the following period we were=20
attacked hardest especially by these last, not actively, of course,=20
but only with the pen, just as you would expect from such folkish=20
goose-quills. For them our principle, =E2=80=98Against those who attack=20
us with force we will defend ourselves with force,=E2=80=99 had something=
=20
terrifying about it. They persistently reproached us, not only=20
with brutal worship of the blackjack, but with lack of spirit as=20
such. The fact that in a public meeting a Demosthenes can be=20
brought to silence if only fifty idiots, supported by their voices=20
and their fists, refuse to let him speak, makes no impression=20
whatever on such a quack. His inborn cowardice never lets him=20
get into such danger. For he does not work =E2=80=98noisily=E2=80=99 and =

not only cowards, but they are also always incompetents and=20
do-nothings. A man who knows a thing, who is aware of a given=20
danger, and sees the possibility of a remedy with his own eyes, has=20
the duty and obligation, by God, not to work =E2=80=98 silently,=E2=80=99 b=
ut to=20
stand up before the whole public against the evil and for its cure.=20
If he does not do so, he is a disloyal, miserable weakling who=20
fails either from cowardice or from laziness and inability. To=20
be sure, this does not apply at all to most of these people, for=20
they know absolutely nothing, but behave as though they knew=20
God knows what; they can do nothing but try to swindle the=20
whole world with their tricks; they are lazy, but with the =E2=80=98 silent=
=E2=80=99=20
work they claim to do, they arouse the impression of an enormous=20
and conscientious activity; in short, they are swindlers, political=20
crooks who hate the honest work of others. As soon as one of=20
these folkish moths praises the darkness 1 of silence, we can bet a=20
thousand to one that by it he produces nothing, but steals, steals=20
from the fruits of other people=E2=80=99s work.=20

To top all this, there is the arrogance and conceited effrontery=20
with which this lazy, light-shunning rabble fall upon the work of=20
others, trying to criticize it from above, thus in reality aiding the=20
mortal enemies of our nationality.=20

Every last agitator who possesses the courage to stand on a=20
tavern table among his adversaries, to defend his opinions with=20
manly forthrightness, does more than a thousand of these lying,=20
treacherous sneaks. He will surely be able to convert one man=20
or another and win him for the movement. It will be possible to=20
examine his achievement and establish the effect of his activity=20
by its results. Only the cowardly swindlers who praise their=20
=E2=80=98 silent=E2=80=99 work and thus wrap themselves in the protective c=
loak=20
of a despicable anonymity, are good for nothing and may in the=20

of our people.=20

The First Big Mass Meeting=20


365=20


At the beginning of 1920, I urged the holding of the first great=20
mass meeting. Differences of opinion arose. A few leading party-=20
members regarded the affair as premature and hence disastrous=20
in effect. The Red press had begun to concern itself with us and=20
we were fortunate enough gradually to achieve its hatred. We=20
had begun to speak in the discussions at other meetings. Of=20
course, each of us was at once shouted down. There was, how=C2=AC=20
ever, some success. People got to know us and proportionately=20
as their knowledge of us deepened, the aversion and rage against=20
us grew. And thus we were entitled to hope that in our first great=20
mass meeting we would be visited by a good many of our friends=20
from the Red camp.=20

I, too, realized that there was great probability of the meeting=20
being broken up. But the struggle had to be carried through, if=20
not now, a few months later. It was entirely in our power to=20
make the movement eternal on the very first day by blindly and=20
ruthlessly fighting for it. I knew above all the mentality of the=20
adherents of the Red side far too well, not to know that resistance=20
to the utmost not only makes the biggest impression, but also=20
wins supporters. And so we just had to be resolved to put up=20
this resistance.=20

Herr Harrer, 1 then first chairman of the party, felt he could=20
not support my views with regard to the time chosen and conse=C2=AC=20
quently, being an honest, upright man, he withdrew from the=20
leadership of the party. His place was taken by Herr Anton=20
Drexler. I had reserved for myself the organization of propa=C2=AC=20
ganda and began ruthlessly to carry it out.=20

And so, the date of February 4, 1920, was set for the holding of=20
this first great mass meeting of the still unknown movement .=20

I personally conducted the preparations. They were very brief.=20

1 Harrer was for the masses whom he claimed Hitler was alienating. He=20
believed in telling the truth and opposed Hitler=E2=80=99s unbridled propag=
anda.=20
He also opposed anti-Semitism and the wealthy backers whom Hitler was=20
trying to bring into the movement. After the acceptance of the 25 Points=20
which he considered demagogic and which included the anti-Semitic Point 4,=
=20
tie resigned.=20


366=20


Mein Kampf=20


Altogether the whole apparatus was adjusted to make lightning=20
decisions. Its aim was to enable us to take a position on current=20
questions in the form of mass meetings within twenty-four hours.=20
They were to be announced by posters and leaflets whose content=20
was determined according to those guiding principles which in=20
rough outlines I have set down in my treatise on propaganda.=20
Effect on the broad masses, concentration on a few points, con=C2=AC=20
stant repetition of the same, self-assured and self-reliant framing=20
of the text in the forms of an apodictic statement, greatest perse=C2=AC=20
verance in distribution and patience in awaiting the effect.=20

On principle, the color red was chosen; it is the most exciting;=20
we knew it would infuriate and provoke our adversaries the most=20
and thus bring us to their attention and memory whether they=20
liked it or not.=20

In the following period the inner fraternization in Bavaria=20
between the Marxists and the Center as a political party was=20
most clearly shown in the concern with which the ruling Bavarian=20
People=E2=80=99s Party tried to weaken the effect of our posters on the=20
Red working masses and later to prohibit them. If the police=20
found no other way to proceed against them, =E2=80=98 considerations of=20
traffic=E2=80=99 had to do the trick, till finally, to please the inner, si=
lent=20
Red ally, these posters, which had given back hundreds of=20
thousands of workers, incited and seduced by internationalism,=20
to their German nationality, were forbidden entirely with the=20
helping hand of a so-called German National People=E2=80=99s Party. 1=20
As an appendix and example to our young movement, I am adding=20
a number of these proclamations. They come from a period=20
embracing nearly three years; they can best illustrate the mighty=20
struggle which the young movement fought at this time. They=20
will also bear witness to posterity of the will and honesty of our=20
convictions and the despotism of the so-called national authori=C2=AC=20
ties in prohibiting, just because they personally found it uncom=C2=AC=20
fortable, a nationalization which would have won back broad=20
masses of our nationality.=20

They will also help to destroy the opinion that there had been=20

POHNER AND FRICK=20

a national government as such in Bavaria and also document for=20
posterity the fact that the national Bavaria of 1919, 1920, 1921,=20
1922, 1923 was not forsooth the result of a national government,=20
but that the government was merely forced to take consideration=20
of a people that was gradually feeling national. 1=20

The governments themselves did everything to eliminate this=20
process of recovery and to make it impossible.=20

Here only two men must be excluded:=20

Ernst Pohner , the police president at that time, and Chief=20
Deputy Frick, 2 his faithful advisor, were the only higher state=20
officials who even then had the courage to be first Germans and=20
then officials. Ernst Pohner was the only man in a responsible=20
post who did not curry favor with the masses, but felt responsible=20
to his nationality and was ready to risk and sacrifice everything,=20
even if necessary his personal existence, for the resurrection of=20
the German people whom he loved above all things. And for this=20
reason he was always a troublesome thorn in the eyes of those=20

1 =E2=80=98auf ein allmdhlich national jiihlendes Volk 2=20

2 Ernst Pohner, former Bavarian police president, became a justice of the=
=20
Bavarian Supreme Court in 1921. It was he who induced the Munich police=20
not to interfere with Hitler=E2=80=99s Putsch of November 8, 1923. At the t=
rial, he=20
declared: =E2=80=98For five years I did nothing but high treason.=E2=80=99 =
He was convicted=20
and sentenced to some months of imprisonment, but was prevented from=20
serving his term by his election as a Volkisch deputy in the Bavarian Diet.=
=20
After the trial he became disillusioned with the Nazis, mainly because of=
=20
personalities, but did not openly break with them. He joined the German=20
Nationalists. Some months later he was killed in an automobile accident.=20

Wilhelm Frick was one of the few Nazi leaders who did not fight in the=20
War. Though in good health, he remained an official in the Palatinate.=20
After the Republic of Councils he became chief of the political police in=
=20
Munich. He spent some months in prison for his part in neutralizing the=20
police during the Putsch , but was released when elected to the Reichstag.=
=20
He was the first National Socialist appointed to a provincial cabinet =E2=
=80=94 as=20
minister of the interior in Thuringia. In 1930 he tried to obtain German=20
citizenship for Hitler by making him a gendarme in the small Thuringian=20
town of Hildburghausen. Hitler himself dropped the scheme as a result of=20
public ridicule. When Hitler became Chancellor, in January, 1933, Frick be=
=C2=AC=20
came Reich Minister of the Interior. He helped the National Socialist revo=

the interest of their people and the necessary uprising for its=20
freedom, but by the boss=E2=80=99s orders, without regard for the welfare=
=20
of the national trust confided in them.=20

And above all he was one of those natures who, contrasting=20
with most of the guardians of our so-called state authority, do=20
not fear the enmity of traitors to the people and the nation, but=20
long for it as for a treasure which a decent man must take for=20
granted. The hatred of Jews and Marxists, their whole campaign=20
of lies and slander, were for him the sole happiness amid the=20
misery of our people.=20

A man of granite honesty, of antique simplicity and German=20
straightforwardness, for whom the words =E2=80=98Sooner dead than a=20
slave=E2=80=99 were no phrase but the essence of his whole being.=20

He and his collaborator, Dr. Frick, are in my eyes the only=20
men in a state position who possess the right to be called co=C2=AC=20
creators of a national Bavaria.=20

Before we proceeded to hold our first mass meeting, not only=20
did the necessary propaganda material have to be made ready,=20
but the main points of the program also had to be put into print.=20

In the second volume I shall thoroughly develop the guiding=20
principles which we had in mind, particularly in framing the=20
program. Here I shall only state that it was done, not only to=20
give the young movement form and content, but to make its=20
aims understandable to the broad masses.=20

Circles of the so-called intelligentsia have mocked and ridiculed=20
this and attempted to criticize it. But the soundness of our point=20
of view at that time has been shown by the effectiveness of this=20
program.=20

In these years I have seen dozens of new movements arise and=20
they have all vanished and evaporated without trace. A single=20
one remains: The National Socialist German Workers=E2=80=99 Party.=20
And today more than ever I harbor the conviction that people can=20
combat it, that they can attempt to paralyze it, that petty party=20
ministers can forbid us to speak and write, but that they will=20
never prevent the victory of our ideas.=20

When not even memory will reveal the names of the entire=20
present-cLy state conception and its advocates, the fundamentals=20
of the National Socialist program will be the foundations of a=20
coming state.=20

Our four months=E2=80=99 activities at meetings up to January, 1920,=20
had slowly enabled us to save up the small means that we needed=20
for printing our first leaflet, our first poster, and our program.=20

If I take the movement=E2=80=99s first large mass meeting as the con=C2=AC=
=20
clusion of this volume, it is because by it the party burst the=20
narrow bonds of a small club and for the first time exerted a=20
determining influence on the mightiest factor of our time,=20
public opinion.=20

I myself at that time had but one concern: Will the hall be=20
filled, or will we speak to a yawning hall? 1 I had the unshakable=20
inner conviction that if the people came, the day was sure to be=20
a great success for the young movement. And so I anxiously=20
looked forward to that evening.=20

The meeting was to be opened at 7:30. At 7:15 I entered the=20
Festsaal of the Hofbrauhaus on the Platzl in Munich, and my=20
heart nearly burst for joy. The gigantic hall =E2=80=94 for at that time=20
it still seemed to me gigantic =E2=80=94 was overcrowded with people,=20
shoulder to shoulder, a mass numbering almost two thousand=20
people. And above all =E2=80=94 those people to whom we wanted to=20
appeal had come. Far more than half the hall seemed to be=20
occupied by Communists and Independents. 2 They had resolved=20
that our first demonstration would come to a speedy end.=20

But it turned out differently. After the first speaker had=20
finished, I took the floor. A few minutes later there was a hail of=20
shouts, there were violent clashes in the hall, a handful of the=20
most faithful war comrades and other supporters battled with the=20
disturbers, and only little by little were able to restore order.=20

Mein Kampf=20


I was able to go on speaking. After half an hour the applause=20
slowly began to drown out the screaming and shouting.=20

I now took up the program and began to explain it for the=20
first time.=20

From minute to minute the interruptions were increasingly=20
drowned out by shouts of applause. And when I finally submitted=20
the twenty-five theses, point for point, to the masses and asked=20
them personally to pronounce judgment on them, one after an=C2=AC=20
other was accepted with steadily mounting joy, unanimously=20
and again unanimously, and when the last thesis had found=20
its way to the heart of the masses, there stood before me a hall=20
full of people united by a new conviction, a new faith, a new will.=20

When after nearly four hours the hall began to empty and the=20
crowd, shoulder to shoulder, began to move, shove, press toward=20
the exit like a slow stream, I knew that now the principles of a=20
movement which could no longer be forgotten were moving out=20
among the German people.=20

A fire was kindled from whose flame one day the sword must=20
come which would regain freedom for the Germanic Siegfried=20
and life for the German nation.=20

And side by side with the coming resurrection, I sensed that=20
the goddess of inexorable vengeance for the perjured deed of=20
November 9, 1919, was striding forth.=20

Thus slowly the hall emptied.=20

Philosophy and Party=20


On February 24, 1920, the first great pub-=20
lie demonstration of our young movement took place. In the=20
Festsaal of the Munich Hofbrauhaus the twenty-five theses of=20
the new party=E2=80=99s program were submitted to a crowd of almost two=20
thousand and every single point was accepted amid jubilant ap=C2=AC=20
proval.=20

With this the first guiding principles and directives were issued=20
for a struggle which was to do away with a veritable mass of old=20
traditional conceptions and opinions and with unclear, yes, harm=C2=AC=20
ful, aims. Into the rotten and cowardly bourgeois world and into=20
the triumphant march of the Marxist wave of conquest a new=20
power phenomenon was entering, which at the eleventh hour=20
would halt the chariot of doom.=20

It was self-evident that the new movement could hope to=20
achieve the necessary importance and the required strength for=20
this gigantic struggle only if it succeeded from the very first day=20
in arousing in the hearts of its supporters the holy conviction that=20
with it political life was to be given, not to a new election slogan ,=20
but to a new philosophy of fundamental significance.=20

We must bear in mind from what wretched viewpoints so-called=20
=E2=80=98 party programs 1 are normally patched together and from time to=
=20
time refurbished or remodeled. We must submit the driving mo=C2=AC=20

y=20

Mein Kampe=20


standing for the evaluation of these programmatical monstrosities.=20

It is always one sole concern which impels men to set up new=20
programs or to change existing ones: concern for the next election.=20
As soon as it dawns on these parliamentary =E2=80=98 jugglers =E2=80=99 tha=
t the be=C2=AC=20
loved people are again revolting and would like to slip out of the=20
harness of the old party cart, they begin to repaint the shafts.=20
Then come the stargazers and party astrologers, the so-called=20
=E2=80=98experienced/ =E2=80=98shrewd=E2=80=99 men, old parliamentarians as=
 a rule, who=20
in their =E2=80=98 rich period of apprenticeship =E2=80=99 can recall analo=
gous cases=20
when the patience of the masses had burst, and who now sense=20
that something similar is again menacingly close. And so they=20
take up the old prescriptions, form a =E2=80=98 commission/ go about lis=C2=
=AC=20
tening to the voice of the beloved people, sniff at the products of=20
the press, and thus slowly scent what the dear broad masses=20
would like to have, what they detest and what they hope for.=20
Every professional group, even every class of employees, is stud=C2=AC=20
ied with the greatest precision and their most secret wishes in=C2=AC=20
vestigated. Even the =E2=80=98bad slogans=E2=80=99 of the dangerous opposit=
ion=20
then suddenly become ripe for examination, and, not seldom to=20
the greatest amazement of their original inventors and dissemina=C2=AC=20
tors, turn up, quite innocently and naturally, in the old parties=E2=80=99=
=20
treasury of knowledge.=20

And so the commissions come together and =E2=80=98revise=E2=80=99 the old=
=20
program and frame a new one (and in so doing the gentlemen=20
change their convictions as a soldier in the field changes his shirt,=20
which is when the old one is full of lice!), in which everybody gets=20
his share. The peasant gets protection for his agriculture, the in=C2=AC=20
dustrialist protection for his product, the consumer protection for=20
his purchase, the teachers=E2=80=99 salaries are raised, the civil servants=
=E2=80=99=20
pensions are improved, widows and orphans are to be taken care=20
of most liberally by the state, trade is promoted, tariffs are to=20
be reduced, and taxes are pretty much, if not altogether, done=20
away with. Occasionally it transpires that some group has been=20
forgotten after all, or that some demand circulating among the=20
people has not been heard of. Then anything there is room for is=20
patched in with the greatest haste, until the framers can hope with=20


The Life of a People=E2=80=99s Deputy=20


375=20


a clear conscience that the army of run-of-the-mill petty bourgeois=20
with their women have been pacified and are simply delighted.=20
Thus inwardly armed with confidence in God and the unshakable=20
stupidity of the voting citizenry, the politicians can begin the=20
fight for the =E2=80=98remaking=E2=80=99 of the Reich as they call it.=20

Then, when election day is past and the parliamentarians have=20
held their last mass meeting in five years, to turn from the train=C2=AC=20
ing of the plebs to their higher and more agreeable tasks, the=20
program commission again dissolves and the fight for the re=C2=AC=20
modeling of things again takes the form of a struggle for daily=20
bread: which in parliament is known as attendance fees.=20

Every morning Mr. People=E2=80=99s deputy betakes himself to the=20
exalted House, and even if he doesn=E2=80=99t go in all the way, he at=20
least goes as far as the anteroom where the attendance lists are=20
kept. Aggressively serving the people, he there enters his name=20
and as well-deserved reward accepts a small remuneration for=20
these continuous and exhausting exertions.=20

After four years, or otherwise during critical weeks when the=20
dissolution of the parliamentary bodies begins to loom closer and=20
closer, an unconquerable urge suddenly comes over the gentle=C2=AC=20
men. Just as a caterpillar cannot help turning into a butterfly,=20
these parliamentary larvae leave their parliamentary cocoons=20
and, endowed with wings, fly out among the beloved people.=20
Again they talk to their voters, speak of the enormous work they=20
have done and the malignant stubbornness of their opponents,=20
but the incomprehensible masses, instead of gratefully applaud=C2=AC=20
ing, sometimes hurl vulgar, even bitter, epithets at their heads.=20
If this ingratitude on the part of the people rises to a certain de=C2=AC=
=20
gree, only a single means can help: the party=E2=80=99s sheen must be=20
brushed off, the program needs improvement, the commission=20
comes back to life, and the swindle begins again from the begin=C2=AC=20
ning. In view of the granite stupidity of our humanity, we have=20
no need to be surprised at the outcome. Led by their press and=20
dazzled by a new and alluring program, the =E2=80=98bourgeois=E2=80=99 as w=
ell=20
as the =E2=80=98proletarian=E2=80=99 voting cattle return to the common sta=
ble=20
and again vote for their old misleaders.=20


376=20


Mein Kampf=20


Thus, the man of the people and the candidate of the working=20
classes turns himself back into the parliamentary caterpillar and=20
again fattens on the foliage of state life, and again after four=20
years turns back into a gleaming butterfly.=20

There is scarcely anything more depressing than to observe this=20
whole process in the light of sober reality, to be obliged to witness=20
this constantly repeated deception.=20

From such spiritual soil the bourgeois camp, you may be as=C2=AC=20
sured, cannot draw the strength to carry on the struggle with the=20
organized power of Marxism.=20

And of this the gentlemen never think seriously. In view of all=20
the admitted narrow-mindedness and mental inferiority of these=20
parliamentary medicine-men of the white race, they themselves=20
cannot seriously imagine that by way of Western democracy they=20
can fight against a doctrine for which democracy, along with=20
everything connected with it, is at best a means used to paralyze=20
the adversary and to create a free path for its own activity.=20
Though at present a part of the Marxists shrewdly try to pretend=20
that they are inseparably linked with the principles of democracy,=20
do not forget if you please that in the critical hour these gentle=C2=AC=20
men didn=E2=80=99t care a damn about a majority decision in the Western-=20
democratic sense! This was in the days when the bourgeois parlia=C2=AC=20
mentarians saw the security of the Reich guaranteed by the mon=C2=AC=20
umental small-mindedness of a superior number, while the Marx=C2=AC=20
ists, with a band of bums, deserters, party bosses, and Jewish=20
journalists, abruptly seized power, thus giving democracy a re=C2=AC=20
sounding slap in the face. So it really takes the credulous mind of=20
one of these parliamentary medicine-men of bourgeois democracy=20
to imagine that now or in the future the brutal determination of=20
those interested in and supporting that world plague could be=20
exorcised merely by the magic formulas of a Western parliamenta-=20
rianism.=20

The Marxists will march with democracy until they succeed in=20
indirectly obtaining for their criminal aims the support of even=20
the national intellectual world, destined by them for extermina=C2=AC=20
tion. If today they came to the conviction that from the witches=E2=80=99=
=20


Marxism and Democratic Principle=20


377=20


cauldron of our parliamentary democracy a majority could be=20
brewed, which =E2=80=94 and even if only on the basis of its legislating=20
majority =E2=80=94 would seriously attack Marxism, the parliamentary=20
jugglery would come to an end at once. The banner-bearers of=20
the Red International would then, instead of addressing an appeal=20
to the democratic conscience, emit a fiery call to the proletarian=20
masses, and their struggle at one stroke would be removed from=20
the stuffy air of our parliamentary meeting halls to the factories=20
and the streets. Democracy would be done for immediately;=20
what the mental dexterity of those people's apostles in the parlia=C2=AC=20
ments had failed to do, the crowbar and sledgehammer of incited=20
proletarian masses would instantly succeed in doing, as in the=20
fall of 1918: they would drive it home to the bourgeois world how=20
insane it is to imagine that they can oppose Jewish world domina=C2=AC=20
tion with the methods of Western democracy.=20

As I have said, it requires a credulous mind to bind oneself,=20
in facing such a player, by rules which for him are only good for=20
bluff or his own profit, and are thrown overboard as soon as they=20
cease to be to his advantage.=20

Since with all parties of a so-called bourgeois orientation in=20
reality the whole political struggle actually consists in nothing=20
but a mad rush for seats in parliament, in which convictions and=20
principles are thrown overboard like sand ballast whenever it=20
seems expedient, their programs are naturally tuned accordingly=20
and =E2=80=94 inversely, to be sure =E2=80=94 their forces also measured by=
 the=20
same standard. They lack that great magnetic attraction which=20
alone the masses always follow under the compelling impact of=20
towering great ideas, the persuasive force of absolute belief in=20
them, coupled with a fanatical courage to fight for them.=20

At a time when one side, armed with all the weapons of a philos=C2=AC=20
ophy, a thousand times criminal though it may he, sets out to storm=20
an existing order, the other side, now and forever can offer resistance=20
only if it clads itself in the forms of a new faith, in our case a politi=
=C2=AC=20
cal one, and for a weak-kneed, cowardly defensive substitutes the=20
battle-cry of courageous and brutal attack. And so, if today our=20
movement gets the witty reproach that it is working toward a=20


378=20


Mein Kampf=20


=E2=80=98 revolution ,=E2=80=99 especially from the so-called national bour=
geois min=C2=AC=20
isters, say of the Bavarian Center, the only answer we can give=20
one of political twerps is this: Yes, indeed, we are trying to make=20
up for what you in your criminal stupidity failed to do. By=20
the principles of your parliamentary cattle-trading, you helped to=20
drag the nation into the abyss; but we, in the form of attack=20
and by setting up a new philosophy of life and by fanatically and=20
indomitably defending its principles, shall build for our people=20
the steps on which it will some day climb back into the temple of=20
freedom.=20

And so, in the founding period of our movement, our first con=C2=AC=20
cern had always to be directed toward preventing the host of=20
warriors for an exalted conviction from becoming a mere club for=20
the advancement of parliamentary interests.=20

The first precautionary measure was the creation of a program=20
which aimed at a development which by its very inner greatness=20
seemed apt to scare away the small and feeble spirits of our pres=C2=AC=20
ent party politicians.=20

How correct was our conception of the necessity of programma=C2=AC=20
tic aims of the sharpest stamp could be seen most clearly from=20
those catastrophic weaknesses which finally led to the collapse=20
of Germany.=20

From the realization of these weaknesses a new state concep=C2=AC=20
tion, which in itself in turn is an essential ingredient of a new=20
world conception, would inevitably take form.=20


* * #=20


In the first volume I have dealt with the word Tolkish/ in so=20
far as I was forced to establish that this term seems inadequately=20
defined to permit the formation of a solid fighting community.=20
All sorts of people, with a yawning gulf between everything es=C2=AC=20
sential in their opinions, are running around today under the=20
blanket term =E2=80=98folkish.=E2=80=99 Therefore, before I proceed to the =
tasks=20
and aims of the National Socialist German Workers=E2=80=99 Party, I=20


The =E2=80=98Folkish=E2=80=99 Concept=20


379=20


should like to give a clarification of the concept =E2=80=98folkish,=E2=80=
=99 as well=20
as its relation to the party movement.=20

The concept =E2=80=98folkish=E2=80=99 seems as vaguely defined, open to as=
=20
many interpretations and as unlimited in practical application=20
as, for instance, the word =E2=80=98 religious/ and it is very hard to con=
=C2=AC=20
ceive of anything absolutely precise under this designation,=20
either in the sense of intellectual comprehension or of practical=20
effects. The designation =E2=80=98religious=E2=80=99 only becomes tangibly =
con=C2=AC=20
ceivable in the moment when it becomes connected with a defi=C2=AC=20
nitely outlined form of its practice. It is a very lovely statement=20
and usually apt, to describe a man=E2=80=99s nature as =E2=80=98profoundly =
relig=C2=AC=20
ious.=E2=80=99 Perhaps there are a few people who feel satisfied by such a=
=20
very general description, to whom it can even convey a definite,=20
.more or less sharp, picture of that soul-state. But, since the great=20
masses consist neither of philosophers nor of saints, such a very=20
general religious idea will as a rule mean to the individual only=20
the liberation of his individual thought and action, without, how=C2=AC=20
ever, leading to that efficacy which arises from religious inner=20
longing in the moment when, from the purely metaphysical in=C2=AC=20
finite world of ideas, a clearly delimited faith forms. Assuredly,=20
this is not the end in itself, but only a means to the end; yet it is=20
the indispensably necessary means which alone makes possible=20
the achievement of the end. This end, however, is not only ideal,=20
but in the last analysis also eminently practical. And in general=20
we must clearly acknowledge the fact that the highest ideals al=C2=AC=20
ways correspond to a deep vital necessity, just as the nobility=20
of the most exalted beauty lies in the last analysis only in what is=20
logically most expedient.=20

By helping to raise man above the level of bestial vegetation,=20
faith contributes in reality to the securing and safeguarding of his=20
existence. Take away from present-day mankind its education-=20
based, religious-dogmatic principles =E2=80=94 or, practically speaking,=20
ethical-moral principles =E2=80=94 by abolishing this religious education,=
=20
but without replacing it by an equivalent, and the result will be=20
a grave shock to the foundations of their existence. We may=20
therefore state that not only does man live in order to serve higher=20


380=20


Mein Kampf=20


ideals, but that, conversely, these higher ideals also provide the=20
premise for his existence. Thus the circle closes.=20

Of course, even the general designation =E2=80=98religious=E2=80=99 include=
s=20
various basic ideas or convictions, for example, the indestruc=C2=AC=20
tibility of the soul, the eternity of its existence, the existence of a=20
higher being, etc. But all these ideas, regardless how convincing=20
they may be for the individual, are submitted to the critical ex=C2=AC=20
amination of this individual and hence to a fluctuating affirma=C2=AC=20
tion or negation until emotional divination or knowledge assumes=20
the binding force of apodictic faith. This, above all, is the fight=C2=AC=
=20
ing factor which makes a breach and opens the way for the recog=C2=AC=20
nition of basic religious views.=20

Without clearly delimited faith, religiosity with its unclarity=20
and multiplicity of form would not only be worthless for human=20
life, but would probably contribute to general disintegration.=20

The situation with the term =E2=80=98 folkish =E2=80=99 is similar to that =
with the=20
term =E2=80=98religious.=E2=80=99 In it, too, there lie various basic reali=
zations.=20
Though of eminent importance, they are, however, so unclearly=20
defined in form that they rise above the value of a more or less=20
acceptable opinion only if they are fitted into the framework of a=20
political party as basic elements. For the realization of philosophi=C2=AC=
=20
cal ideals and of the demands derived from them no more occurs=20
through men=E2=80=99s pure feeling or inner will in themselves than the=20
achievement of freedom through the general longing for it. No, only=20
when the ideal urge for independence gets a fighting organization in=20
the form of military instruments of power can the pressing desire of=20
a people be transformed into glorious reality.=20

Every philosophy of life, even if it is a thousand times correct and=20
of highest benefit to humanity, will remain without significance for=20
the practical shaping of a people=E2=80=99s life, as long as its principles=
 have=20
not become the banner of a fighting movement which for its part in=20
turn will be a party as long as its activity has not found completion=20
in the victory of its ideas and its party dogmas have not become the=20
new state principles of a people=E2=80=99s community.=20

But if a spiritual conception of a general nature is to serve as=20
a foundation for a future development, the first presupposition is=20


From Political Creed to Fighting Community 381=20

to obtain unconditional clarity with regard to the nature, essence,=20
and scope of this conception, since only on such a basis can a move=C2=AC=
=20
ment be formed which by the inner homogeneity of its convic=C2=AC=20
tions can develop the necessary force for struggle. From general=20
ideas a political program must be stamped, from a general phil=C2=AC=20
osophy of life a definite political faith. The latter, since its goal=20
must be practically attainable, will not only have to serve the=20
idea in itself, but will also have to take into consideration the=20
means of struggle which are available and must be used for the=20
achievement of this idea. The abstractly correct spiritual con=C2=AC=20
ception, which the theoretician has to proclaim, must be coupled=20
with the practical knowledge of the politician. And so an eternal=20
ideal, serving as the guiding star of mankind, must unfortunately=20
resign itself to taking the weaknesses of this mankind into con=C2=AC=20
sideration, if it wants to avoid shipwreck at the very outset on=20
the shoals of general human inadequacy. To draw from the=20
realm of the eternally true and ideal that which is humanly pos=C2=AC=20
sible for small mortals, and make it take form, the search after=20
truth must be coupled with knowledge of the people=E2=80=99s psyche.=20

This transformation of a general, philosophical, ideal concep=C2=AC=20
tion of the highest truth into a definitely delimited, tightly or=C2=AC=20
ganized political community of faith and struggle, unified in=20
spirit and will, is the most significant achievement, since on its=20
happy solution alone the possibility of the victory of an idea de=C2=AC=20
pends. From the army of often millions of men, who as individ=C2=AC=20
uals more or less clearly and definitely sense these truths, and in=20
part perhaps comprehend them, one man must step forward who=20
with apodictic force will form granite principles from the waver=C2=AC=20
ing idea-world of the broad masses and take up the struggle for=20
their sole correctness, until from the shifting waves of a free=20
thought-world there will arise a brazen cliff of solid unity in faith=20
and will.=20

The general right for such an activity is based on necessity, the=20
personal right on success.=20


382=20


Mein Kampf=20


If from the word =E2=80=98folkish=E2=80=99 we try to peel out the innermost=
=20
kernel of meaning, we arrive at the following:=20

Our present political world view, current in Germany, is based=20
in general on the idea that creative, culture-creating force must=20
indeed be attributed to the state, but that it has nothing to do=20
with racial considerations, but is rather a product of economic=20
necessities, or, at best, the natural result of a political urge for=20
power. This underlying view, if logically developed, leads not=20
only to a mistaken conception of basic racial forces, but also to=20
an underestimation of the individual. For a denial of the differ=C2=AC=20
ence between the various races with regard to their general cul=C2=AC=20
ture-creating forces must necessarily extend this greatest of all=20
errors to the judgment of the individual. The assumption of the=20
equality of the races then becomes a basis for a similar way of=20
viewing peoples and finally individual men. And hence interna=C2=AC=20
tional Marxism itself is only the transference, by the Jew, Karl=20
Marx, of a philosophical attitude and conception, which had actu=C2=AC=20
ally long been in existence, into the form of a definite political=20
creed. Without the subsoil of such generally existing poisoning,=20
the amazing success of this doctrine would never have been pos=C2=AC=20
sible. Actually Karl Marx was only the one among millions who,=20
with the sure eye of the prophet, recognized in the morass of a=20
slowly decomposing world the most essential poisons, extracted=20
them, and, like a wizard, prepared them into a concentrated solu=C2=AC=20
tion for the swifter annihilation of the independent existence of=20
free nations on this earth. And all this in the service of his race.=20

His Marxist doctrine is a brief spiritual extract of the philoso=C2=AC=20
phy of life that is generally current today. And for this reason=20
alone any struggle of our so-called bourgeois world against it is=20
impossible, absurd in fact, since this bourgeois world is also es=C2=AC=20
sentially infected by these poisons, and worships a view of life=20
which in general is distinguished from the Marxists only by de=C2=AC=20
grees and personalities. The bourgeois world is Marxist, but be=C2=AC=20
lieves in the possibility of the rule of certain groups of men (bour=C2=AC=
=20
geoisie), while Marxism itself systematically plans to hand the=20
world over to the Jews.=20


Folkish View of Race and Personality=20


383=20


In opposition to this, the folkish philosophy finds the impor=C2=AC=20
tance of mankind in its basic racial elements. In the state it sees=20
on principle only a means to an end and construes its end as the=20
preservation of the racial existence of man. Thus, it by no means=20
believes in an equality of the races, but along with their difference=20
it recognizes their higher or lesser value and feels itself obligated,=20
through this knowledge, to promote the victory of the better and=20
stronger, and demand the subordination of the inferior and weaker=20
in accordance with the eternal will that dominates this universe.=20
Thus, in principle, it serves the basic aristocratic idea of Nature=20
and believes in the validity of this law down to the last individual.=20
It sees not only the different value of the races, but also the differ=C2=
=AC=20
ent value of individuals. From the mass it extracts the impor=C2=AC=20
tance of the individual personality, and thus, in contrast to dis=C2=AC=20
organizing Marxism, it has an organizing effect. It believes in the=20
necessity of an idealization of humanity, in which alone it sees=20
the premise for the existence of humanity. But it cannot grant=20
the right to existence even to an ethical idea if this idea represents=20
a danger for the racial life of the bearers of a higher ethics; for in=20
a bastardized and niggerized world all the concepts of the hu=C2=AC=20
manly beautiful and sublime, as well as all ideas of an idealized=20
future of our humanity, would be lost forever.=20

Human culture and civilization on this continent are insepara=C2=AC=20
bly bound up with the presence of the Aryan. If he dies out or=20
declines, the dark veils of an age without culture will again de=C2=AC=20
scend on this globe.=20

The undermining of the existence of human culture by the=20
destruction of its bearer seems in the eyes of a folkish philosophy=20
the most execrable crime. Anyone who dares to lay hands on the=20
highest image of the Lord commits sacrilege against the benevo=C2=AC=20
lent creator of this miracle and contributes to the expulsion from=20
paradise.=20

And so the folkish philosophy of life corresponds to the inner=C2=AC=20
most will of Nature, since it restores that free play of forces which=20
must lead to a continuous mutual higher breeding, until at last=20
the best of humanity, having achieved possession of this earth.=20


384=20


Mein Kampf=20


will have a free path for activity in domains which will lie partly=20
above it and partly outside it.=20

We all sense that in the distant future humanity must be faced=20
by problems which only a highest race, become master people=20
and supported by the means and possibilities of an entire globe,=20
will be equipped to overcome.=20


At. X=20

=E2=96=A0Jt* *7V* W=20


It is self-evident that so general a statement of the meaningful=20
content of a folkish philosophy can be interpreted in thousands=20
of ways. And actually we find hardly a one of our newer political=20
formations which does not base itself in one way or another on=20
this world view. And, by its very existence in the face of the many=20
others, it shows the difference of its conceptions. And so the=20
Marxist world view, led by a unified top organization, is opposed=20
by a hodge-podge of views which even as ideas are not very im=C2=AC=20
pressive in face of the solid, hostile front. Victories are not gained=20
by such feeble weapons! Not until the international world view =E2=80=94=20
politically led by organized Marxism =E2=80=94 is confronted by a folkish=
=20
world view, organized and led with equal unity, will success,=20
supposing the fighting energy to be equal on both sides, fall to=20
the side of eternal truth.=20

A philosophy can only be organizationally comprehended on the=20
basis of a definite formulation of that philosophy , and what dogmas=20
represent for religious faith , party principles are for a political=20
party in the making.=20

Hence an instrument must be created for the folkish world view=20
which enables it to fight , just as the Marxist party organization=20
creates a free path for internationalism.=20

This is the goal pursued by the National Socialist German=20
Workers=E2=80=99 Party.=20

That such a party formulation of the folkish concept is the pre=C2=AC=20
condition for the victory of the folkish philosophy of life is proved=20
most sharply by a fact which is admitted indirectly at least by the=20


Organization of a Party=20


385=20


enemies of such a party tie. Those very people who never weary=20
of emphasizing that the folkish philosophy is not the =E2=80=98 hereditary=
=20
estate =E2=80=99 of an individual, but that it slumbers or =E2=80=98 lives =
f in the hearts=20
of God knows how many millions, thus demonstrate the fact that=20
the general existence of such ideas was absolutely unable to pre=C2=AC=20
vent the victory of the hostile world view, classically represented=20
by a political party. If this were not so, the German people by=20
this time would have been bound to achieve a gigantic victory=20
and not be standing at the edge of an abyss. What gave the inter=C2=AC=20
national world view success was its representation by a political=20
party organized into storm troops; what caused the defeat of the=20
opposite world view was its lack up to now of a unified body to=20
represent it. Not by unlimited freedom to interpret a general=20
view, but only in the limited and hence integrating form of a=20
political organization can a world view fight and conquer.=20

Therefore, I saw my own task especially in extracting those=20
nuclear ideas from the extensive and unshaped substance of a=20
general world view and remolding them into more or less dogmatic=20
forms which in their clear delimitation are adapted for holding=20
solidly together those men who swear allegiance to them. In=20
other words: From the basic ideas of a general folkish world concep=C2=AC=
=20
tion the National Socialist German Workers' Party takes over the=20
essential fundamental traits, and from them, with due consideration=20
of practical reality, the times, and the available human material as=20
well as its weaknesses, forms a political creed which , in turn, by the=20
strict organizational integration of large human masses thus made=20
possible, creates the precondition for the victorious struggle of this=20
world view.=20

I3y 1920 to 1921, time and again the circles=20
of the present outlived bourgeois world held it up to our young=20
movement that our attitude toward the present-day. state was=20
negative, which made the political crooks of all tendencies feel=20
justified in undertaking to suppress the young prophet of a new=20
world view with all possible means. Of course they purposely=20
forgot that the present bourgeois world itself can no longer form=20
any unified picture of the state concept, that there neither is nor=20
can be any uniform definition of it. For the explainers usually sit=20
in our state universities in the form of political law professors,=20
whose highest task it must be to find explanations and interpreta=C2=AC=20
tions for the more or less unfortunate existence of their momen=C2=AC=20
tary source of bread. The more impossible the nature of such a=20
state is, the more opaque, artificial, and unintelligible are the defin=C2=
=AC=20
itions regarding the purpose of its existence. What, for example,=20
could a royal and imperial university professor formerly write=20
about the sense and purpose of the state in a country whose=20
state existence embodied the greatest monstrosity of the twen=C2=AC=20
tieth century? A grave task if we consider that for the present-=20
day teacher of political law there is less obligation to truth than=20
bondage to a definite purpose. And the purpose is: preservation=20
at any price of the current monstrosity of human mechanism, 1=20
now called state. We have no call to be surprised if in the dis-=20

Three Main Conceptions oe the State 387=20

cussion of this problem practical criteria are avoided as much as=20
possible, and instead the professors dig themselves into a hodge=C2=AC=20
podge of =E2=80=98 ethical/ =E2=80=98 moral/ and other ideal values, tasks,=
 and=20
aims.=20

In general three conceptions can be distinguished:=20

(a) The troop of those who regard the state simply as a more or=20
less voluntary grouping of people under a governmental power.=20

This group is the most numerous. In its ranks are found partic=C2=AC=20
ularly the worshipers of our present-day principle of legitimacy,=20
in whose eyes the will of the people plays no role in this whole=20
matter. According to these saints, a sacred inviolability is based=20
on the mere fact of the state=E2=80=99s existence. To protect this madness=
=20
of human brains, a positively dog-like veneration of so-called=20
state authority is needed. In the minds of such people a means=20
becomes an ultimate end in the twinkling of an eye. The state no=20
longer exists to serve men; men exist in order to worship a state=20
authority which embraces even the most humble spirit, provided=20
he is in any sense an official. Lest this condition of silent, ecstatic=20
veneration turn into one of unrest, the state authority for its=20
part exists only to maintain peace and order. It, too, is now an=20
end and no longer a means. 1 State authority must provide for=20
peace and order, and peace and order in turn must conversely=20
make possible the existence of state authority. Within these=20
two poles all life must now revolve.=20

In Bavaria, such a conception is primarily represented by the=20
political artists of the Bavarian Center, known as the =E2=80=98 Bavarian=
=20
People=E2=80=99s Party=E2=80=99; in Austria, it was the Black-and-Yellow Le=
giti=C2=AC=20
mists; in the Reich itself, unfortunately, it is often so-called con=C2=AC=
=20
servative elements whose conception of the state moves along=20
these paths.=20

(b) The second group of people is somewhat smaller in number,=20
since among it must be reckoned those who at least attach a few=20
conditions to the existence of the state. They desire not only=20

11 ein Zweck .=E2=80=99 Second edition changes this to =E2=80=98kein Zweck =
,=E2=80=99 though this=20
may be a misprint. The meaning then would be: =E2=80=98no longer an end or =
j=C2=BB=20
means.=E2=80=99=20


388=20


Mein Kampf=20


uniform administration, but also, if possible, uniform language =E2=80=94=
=20
if only for general technical reasons of administration. State=20
authority is no longer the sole and exclusive purpose of the state,=20
but to it is added the promotion of the subjects=E2=80=99 welfare. Ideas of=
=20
=E2=80=98freedom/ mostly of a misunderstood nature, inject themselves=20
into the state conceptions of these circles. The form of govern=C2=AC=20
ment no longer seems inviolable by the mere fact of its existence,=20
but is examined as to its expediency. The sanctity of age offers=20
no protection against the criticism of the present. Furthermore,=20
it is a conception which expects that the state above all will=20
beneficially shape the economic life of the individual, and which=20
therefore judges on the basis of practical criteria and general=20
economic conceptions of the profitable. We find the main repre=C2=AC=20
sentatives of these views in the circles of our normal German=20
bourgeoisie, especially in those of our liberal democracy.=20

(c) The third group is numerically the weakest.=20

It regards the state as a means for the realization of usually=20
very unclearly conceived aims of a state-people linguistically=20
stamped and united. The will for a uniform state language is=20
here expressed, not only in the hope of giving this state a founda=C2=AC=20
tion capable of supporting an outward increase of power, but not=20
less in the opinion =E2=80=94 basically erroneous, incidentally =E2=80=94 t=
hat=20
this will make it possible to carry through a nationalization in a=20
definite direction.=20

In the last hundred years it has been a true misery to observe=20
how these circles, sometimes in the best good faith, played with=20
the word =E2=80=98 Germanize .=E2=80=99 I myself still remember how in my y=
outh=20
this very term led to incredibly false conceptions. Even in Pan-=20
German circles the opinion could then be heard that the Austrian-=20
Germans, with the promotion and aid of the government, might=20
well succeed in a Germanization of the Austrian Slavs; these cir=C2=AC=20
cles never even began to realize that Germanization can only be=20
applied to soil and never to people. For what was generally un=C2=AC=20
derstood under this word was only the forced outward acceptance=20
of the German language. But it is a scarcely conceivable fallacy=20
of thought to believe that a Negro or a Chinese, let us say, will=20


False Conceptions oe =E2=80=98 Germanization =E2=80=99=20


389=20


turn into a German because he learns German and is willing to=20
speak the German language in the future and perhaps even give=20
his vote to a German political party. That any such Germaniza=C2=AC=20
tion is in reality a de-Germanization never became clear to our=20
bourgeois national world. For if today, by forcing a universal=20
language on them, obvious differences between different peoples=20
are bridged over and finally effaced, this means the beginning of a=20
bastardization, and hence in our case not a Germanization but a=20
destruction of the Germanic element. Only too frequently does=20
it occur in history that conquering people=E2=80=99s outward instruments=20
of power succeed in forcing their language on oppressed peoples,=20
but that after a thousand years their language is spoken by an=C2=AC=20
other people, and the victors thereby actually become the van=C2=AC=20
quished.=20

Since nationality or rather race does not happen to lie in lan=C2=AC=20
guage but in the blood, we would only be justified in speaking of a=20
Germanization if by such a process we succeeded in transforming=20
the blood of the subjected people. But this is impossible. Unless=20
a blood mixture brings about a change, which, however, means=20
the lowering of the level of the higher race. The final result of=20
such a process would consequently be the destruction of precisely=20
those qualities which had formerly made the conquering people=20
capable of victory. Especially the cultural force would vanish=20
through a mating with the lesser race, even if the resulting mon=C2=AC=20
grels spoke the language of the earlier, higher race a thousand=20
times over. For a time, a certain struggle will take place between=20
the different mentalities, and it may be that the steadily sinking=20
people, in a last quiver of life, so to speak, will bring to light sur=C2=
=AC=20
prising cultural values. But these are only individual elements=20
belonging to the higher race, or perhaps bastards in whom, after=20
the first crossing, the better blood still predominates and tries to=20
struggle through; but never final products of a mixture. In them=20
a culturally backward movement will always manifest itself.=20

Today it must be regarded as a good fortune that a Germaniza=C2=AC=20
tion as intended by Joseph II in Austria was not carried out. Its=20
result would probably have been the preservation of the Austrian=20


390=20


Mein Kampf=20


state, but also the lowering of the racial level of the German nation=20
induced by a linguistic union. In the course of the centuries a=20
certain herd instinct would doubtless have crystallized out, but=20
the herd itself would have become inferior. A state-people would=20
perhaps have been born, but a culture-people would have been=20
lost.=20

For the German nation it was better that such a process of mix=C2=AC=20
ture did not take place, even if this was not due to a noble in=C2=AC=20
sight, but to the shortsighted narrowness of the Habsburgs. If=20
it had turned out differently, the German people could scarcely=20
be regarded as a cultural factor.=20

Not only in Austria, but in Germany as well, so-called national=20
circles were moved by similar false ideas. The Polish policy, de=C2=AC=20
manded by so many, involving a Germanization of the East, was=20
unfortunately based on the same false inference. Here again it=20
was thought that a Germanization of the Polish element could=20
be brought about by a purely linguistic integration with the=20
German element. Here again the result would have been cata=C2=AC=20
strophic; a people of alien race expressing its alien ideas in the=20
German language, compromising the lofty dignity of our own=20
nationality by their own inferiority.=20

How terrible is the damage indirectly done to our Germanism=20
today by the fact that, due to the ignorance of many Americans,=20
the German-jabbering Jews, when they set foot on American soil,=20
are booked to our German account. Surely no one will call the=20
purely external fact that most of this lice-ridden migration from=20
the East speaks German a proof of their German origin and na=C2=AC=20
tionality.=20

What has been profitably Germanized in history is the soil which=20
our ancestors acquired by the sword and settled with German peas=C2=AC=20
ants. In so far as they directed foreign blood into our national body=20
in this process , they contributed to that catastrophic splintering of=20
our inner being which is expressed in German super-individualism=20
=E2=96=A0=E2=80=94 a phenomenon , I am sorry to say, which is praised in ma=
ny=20
quarters.=20

Also in this third group, the state in a certain sense still passes=20


The State Is Not an End in Itself=20


391=20


as an end in itself, and the preservation of the state, conse=C2=AC=20
quently, as the highest task of human existence.=20

In summing up we can state the following: All these views have=20
their deepest root, not in the knowledge that the forces which=20
create culture and values are based essentially on racial elements=20
and that the state must, therefore, in the light of reason, regard=20
its highest task as the preservation and intensification of the race,=20
this fundamental condition of all human cultural development.=20

It was the Jew, Karl Marx, who was able to draw the extreme=20
inference from those false conceptions and views concerning the=20
nature and purpose of a state: by detaching the state concept from=20
racial obligations without being able to arrive at any other=20
equally acknowledged formulation, the bourgeois world even=20
paved the way for a doctrine which denies the state as such.=20

Even in this field, therefore, the struggle of the bourgeois=20
world against the Marxist international must fail completely. It=20
long since sacrificed the foundations which would have been in=C2=AC=20
dispensably necessary for the support of its own ideological=20
world. Their shrewd foe recognized the weaknesses of their own=20
structure and is now storming it with the weapons which they=20
themselves, even if involuntarily, provided.=20

It is, therefore, the first obligation of a new movement, stand=C2=AC=20
ing on the ground of a folkish world view, to make sure that its=20
conception of the nature and purpose of the state attains a uni=C2=AC=20
form and clear character.=20

Thus the basic realization is: that the state represents -no end , hut=20
a means. It is , to be sure , the premise for the formation of a higher=20
human culture , hut not its cause , which lies exclusively in the exist=C2=
=AC=20
ence of a race capable of culture. Hundreds of exemplary states=20
might exist on earth, but if the Aryan culture-bearer died out,=20
there would be no culture corresponding to the spiritual level of=20
the highest peoples of today. We can go even farther and say that=20
the fact of human state formation would not in the least exclude=20
the possibility of the destruction of the human race, provided that=20
superior intellectual ability and elasticity would be lost due to the=20
absence of their racial bearers.=20


392=20


Mein Kampf=20


If today, for example, the surface of the earth were upset by=20
some tectonic event and a new Himalaya rose from the ocean=20
floods, by one single cruel catastrophe the culture of humanity=20
would be destroyed. No state would exist any longer, the bands=20
of all order would be dissolved, the documents of millennial de-=20

'j=20

velopment would be shattered =E2=80=94 a single grfeat held of corpses=20
covered by water and mud. But if from this chaos of horror even=20
a few men of a certain race capable of culture had been preserved,=20
the earth, upon settling, if only after thousands of years, would=20
again get proofs of human creative power. Only the destruction=20
of the last race capable of culture and its individual members=20
would desolate the earth for good. Conversely, we can see even by=20
examples from the present that state formations in their tribal=20
beginnings can, if their racial supporters lack sufficient genius,=20
not preserve them from destruction. Just as great animal species=20
of prehistoric times had to give way to others and vanish without=20
trace, man must also give way if he lacks a definite spiritual force=20
which alone enables him to find the necessary weapons for his=20
self-preservation.=20

The state in itself does not create a specific cultural level; it=20
can only preserve the race which conditions this level. Otherwise=20
the state as such may continue to exist unchanged for centuries=20
while, in consequence of a racial mixture which it has not pre=C2=AC=20
vented, the cultural capacity of a people and the general aspect=20
of its life conditioned by it have long since suffered a profound=20
change. The present-day state, for example, may very well simu=C2=AC=20
late its existence as a formal mechanism for a certain length of=20
time, but the racial poisoning of our national body creates a cul=C2=AC=20
tural decline which even now is terrifyingly manifest.=20

Thus , the precondition for the existence of a higher humanity is=20
not the state, hut the nation possessing the necessary ability.=20

This ability will fundamentally always be present and must=20
only be aroused to practical realization by certain outward con=C2=AC=20
ditions. Culturally and creatively gifted nations, or rather races,=20
bear these useful qualities latent within them, even if at the=20
moment unfavorable outward conditions do not permit a realiza-=20


National Socialist Conception of the State 393=20


tion of these latent tendencies. Hence it is an unbelievable of=C2=AC=20
fense to represent the Germanic peoples of the pre-Christian era=20
as 1 cultureless/ as barbarians. That they never were. Only the=20
harshness of their northern homeland forced them into circum=C2=AC=20
stances which thwarted the development of their creative forces.=20
If, without any ancient world, they had come to the more favor=C2=AC=20
able regions of the south, and if the material provided by lower=20
peoples had given them their first technical implements, the cul=C2=AC=20
ture-creating ability slumbering within them would have grown=20
into radiant bloom just as happened, for example, with the Greeks.=20
But this primeval culture-creating force itself arises in turn not=20
from the northern climate alone. The Laplander, brought to=20
the south, would be no more culture-creating than the Eskimo.=20
For this glorious creative ability was given only to the Aryan,=20
whether he bears it dormant within himself or gives it to awaken=C2=AC=20
ing life, depending whether favorable circumstances permit this=20
or an inhospitable Nature prevents it.=20

From this the following realization results:=20

The state is a means to an end. Its end lies in the preservation=20
and advancement of a community of physically and psychically=20
homogeneous creatures. This preservation itself comprises first of all=20
existence as a race and thereby permits the free development of all the=20
forces dormant in this race. Of them a part will always primarily=20
serve the preservation of physical life, and only the remaining part=20
the promotion of a further spiritual development. Actually the one=20
always creates the precondition for the other.=20

States which do not serve this purpose are misbegotten , monstrosi=C2=AC=20
ties in fact. The fact of their existence changes this no more than the=20
success of a gang of bandits can justify robbery.=20

We National Socialists as champions of a new philosophy of=20
life must never base ourselves on so-called =E2=80=98accepted facts=E2=80=
=99 =E2=80=94=20
and false ones at that. If we did, we would not be the cham=C2=AC=20
pions of a new great idea, but the coolies of the present-day lie.=20
We must distinguish in the sharpest way between the state as a=20
vessel and the race as its content. This vessel has meaning only=20
if it can preserve and protect the content; otherwise it is useless.=20


394=20


Mein Kampe=20


Thus , the highest purpose of a folkish state is concern for the pres=C2=AC=
=20
ervation of those original racial elements which bestow culture and=20
create the beauty and dignity of a higher mankind. We, as Aryans ,=20
can conceive of the state only as the living organism of a nationality=20
which not only assures the preservation of this nationality , but by=20
the development of its spiritual and ideal abilities leads it to the high=
=C2=AC=20
est freedom.=20

But what they try to palm off on us as a state today is usually=20
nothing but a monstrosity born of deepest human error, with un=C2=AC=20
told misery as a consequence.=20

We National Socialists know that with this conception we stand=20
as revolutionaries in the world of today and are also branded as=20
such. But our thoughts and actions must in no way be deter=C2=AC=20
mined by the approval or disapproval of our time, but by the=20
binding obligation to a truth which we have recognized. Then=20
we may be convinced that the higher insight of posterity will=20
not only understand our actions of today, but will also confirm=20
their correctness and exalt them.=20

# # #=20

From this, we National Socialists derive a standard for the=20
evaluation of a state. This value will be relative from the stand=C2=AC=20
point of the individual nationality, absolute from that of human=C2=AC=20
ity as such. This means, in other words:=20

The quality of a state cannot be evaluated according to the cultural=20
level or the power of this state in the frame of the outside world , but=20
solely and exclusively by the degree of this institution=E2=80=99s virtue f=
or the=20
nationality involved in each special case.=20

A state can be designated as exemplary if it is not only com=C2=AC=20
patible with the living conditions of the nationality it is intended=20
to represent, but if in practice it keeps this nationality alive by=20
its own very existence =E2=80=94 quite regardless of the importance of this=
=20
state formation within the framework of the outside world. For=20
the function of the state is not to create abilities, but only to open=20


Criteria eor the Evaluation of a State=20


395=20


the road for those forces which are present. Thus , conversely , a=20
state can he designated as had if , despite a high cidtural level , it=20
dooms the hearer of this culture in his racial composition. For thus=20
it destroys to all intents and purposes the premise for the survival=20
of this culture which it did not create, but which is the fruit of=20
a culture-creating nationality safeguarded by a living integration=20
through the state. The state does not represent the content, but=20
a form. A people=E2=80=99s cultural level at any time does not , therefore =
,=20
provide a standard for measuring the quality of the state in which=20
it lives. It is easily understandable that a people highly endowed=20
with culture offers a more valuable picture than a Negro tribe;=20
nevertheless, the state organism of the former, viewed according=20
to its fulfillment of purpose, can be inferior to that of the Negro.=20
Though the best state and the best state form are not able to ex=C2=AC=20
tract from a people abilities which are simply lacking and never=20
did exist, a bad state is assuredly able to kill originally existing=20
abilities by permitting or even promoting the destruction of the=20
racial culture-bearer.=20

Hence our judgment concerning the quality of a state can prim=C2=AC=20
arily be determined only by the relative utility it possesses for a=20
definite nationality, and in no event by the intrinsic importance=20
attributable to it in the world.=20

This relative judgment can be passed quickly and easily, but=20
the judgment concerning absolute value only with great difficulty,=20
since this absolute judgment is no longer determined merely by=20
the state, but by the quality and level of the nationality in ques=C2=AC=20
tion.=20

If, therefore, we speak of a higher mission of the state, we must=20
not forget that the higher mission lies essentially in the national=C2=AC=
=20
ity whose free development the state must merely make possible=20
by the organic force of its being.=20

Hence, if we propound the question of how the state which we=20
Germans need should be constituted, we must first clearly under=C2=AC=20
stand what kind of people it is to contain and what purpose it=20
is to serve.=20

Our German nationality, unfortunately, is no longer based on a=20


396=20


Mein Kampe=20


unified racial nucleus. The blending process of the various original=20
components has advanced so far that we might speak of a new=20
race. On the contrary, the poisonings of the blood which have be=C2=AC=20
fallen our people, especially since the Thirty Years=E2=80=99 War, have led=
=20
not only to a decomposition of our blood, but also of our soul. The=20
open borders of our fatherland, the association with un-German=20
foreign bodies along these frontier districts, but above all the=20
strong and continuous influx of foreign blood into the interior of=20
the Reich itself, due to its continuous renewal, leaves no time for=20
an absolute blending. No new race is distilled out, the racial con=C2=AC=20
stituents remain side by side, with the result that, especially in=20
critical moments in which otherwise a herd habitually gathers to=C2=AC=20
gether, the German people scatters to all the four winds. Not=20
only are the basic racial elements scattered territorially, but on a=20
small scale within the same territory. Beside Nordic men East=C2=AC=20
erners, beside Easterners Dinarics, beside both of these West=C2=AC=20
erners, and mixtures in between. On the one hand, this is a great=20
disadvantage: the German people lack that sure herd instinct=20
which is based on unity of the blood and, especially in moments=20
of threatening danger, preserves nations from destruction in so=20
far as all petty inner differences in such peoples vanish at once on=20
such occasions and the solid front of a unified herd confronts the=20
common enemy. This co-existence of unblended basic racial ele=C2=AC=20
ments of the most varying kind accounts for what is termed=20
hyper-individualism in Germany. In peaceful periods it may some=C2=AC=20
times do good services, but taking all things together, it has=20
robbed us of world domination. If the German people in its his=C2=AC=20
toric development had possessed that herd unity which other=20
peoples enjoyed, the German Reich today would doubtless be=20
mistress of the globe. World history would have taken a different=20
course, and no one can distinguish whether in this way we would=20
not have obtained what so many blinded pacifists today hope to=20
gain by begging, whining, and whimpering: a peace , supported not=20
by the palm branches of tearful , pacifist female mourners , but based=20
on the victorious sword of a master people , putting the world into the=20
service of a higher culture .=20


Consequences oe Our Racial Division=20


397=20


The fact of the non-existence of a nationality of unified blood=20
has brought us untold misery. It has given capital cities to many=20
small German potentates, but deprived the German people of the=20
master=E2=80=99s right.=20

Today our people are still suffering from this inner division; but=20
what brought us misfortune in the past and present can be our=20
blessing for the future. For detrimental as it was on the one band=20
that a complete blending of our original racial components did=20
not take place, and that the formation of a unified national body=20
was thus prevented, it was equally fortunate on the other hand=20
that in this way at least a part of our best blood was preserved=20
pure and escaped racial degeneration.=20

Assuredly, if there had been a complete blending of our original=20
racial elements, a unified national body would have arisen; how=C2=AC=20
ever, as every racial cross-breeding proves, it would have been=20
endowed with a smaller cultural capacity than the highest of the=20
original components originally possessed. This is the blessing of=20
the absence of complete blending: that today in our German na=C2=AC=20
tional body we still possess great unmixed stocks of Nordic-=20
Germanic people whom we may consider the most precious=20
treasure for our future. In the confused period of ignorance of all=20
racial laws, when a man appeared to be simply a man, with full=20
equality =E2=80=94 clarity may have been lacking with regard to the dif=C2=
=AC=20
ferent value of the various original elements. Today we know that=20
a complete intermixture of the components of our people might,=20
in consequence of the unity thus produced, have given us outward=20
power, but that the highest goal of mankind would have been un=C2=AC=20
attainable, since the sole bearer, whom Fate had clearly chosen=20
for this completion, would have perished in the general racial=20
porridge of the unified people.=20

But what, through none of our doing, a kind Fate prevented,=20
we must today examine and evaluate from the standpoint of=20
the knowledge we have now acquired.=20

Anyone who speaks of a mission of the German people on earth=20
must know that it can exist only in the formation of a state which sees=20
its highest task in the preservation and promotion of the most noble=20


398=20


Mein Kampf=20


elements of our nationality, indeed of all mankind, which still re=C2=AC=20
main intact.=20

Thus, for the first time the state achieves a lofty inner goal.=20
Compared to the absurd catchword about safeguarding law and=20
order, thus laying a peaceable groundwork for mutual swindles,=20
the task of preserving and advancing the highest humanity, given=20
to this earth by the benevolence of the Almighty, seems a truly=20
high mission.=20

From a dead mechanism which only lays claim to existence for=20
its own sake, there must be formed a living organism with the=20
exclusive aim of serving a higher idea.=20

The German Reich as a state must embrace all Germans and has=20
the task, not only of assembling and preserving the most valuable=20
stocks of basic racial elements in this people, but slowly and surely of=20
raising them to a dominant position.=20


vv* Tt* 7T=20


Thus, a condition which is fundamentally one of paralysis is=20
replaced by a period of struggle, but as everywhere and always=20
in this world, here, too, the saying remains valid that =E2=80=98 he who re=
sts=20
=E2=80=94 rusts/ and, furthermore, that victory lies eternally and exclu=C2=
=AC=20
sively in attack. The greater the goal we have in mind in our=20
struggle, and the smaller the understanding of the broad masses=20
for it may be at the moment, all the more gigantic, as the experi=C2=AC=20
ence of world history shows, will be the success =E2=80=94 and the signifi=
=C2=AC=20
cance of this success if the goal is correctly comprehended and the=20
struggle is carried through with unswerving perseverance.=20

Of course it may be more soothing for many of our present of=C2=AC=20
ficial helmsmen of the state to work for the preservation of an=20
existing condition than having to fight for a new one. They will=20
find it much easier to regard the state as a mechanism which=20
exists simply in order to keep itself alive, since in turn their lives=20
=E2=80=98belong to the state =E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 as they are accustomed to =
put it. As=20
though something which sprang from the nationality could=20


World History Is Made by Minorities=20


399=20


logically serve anything else than the nationality or man could=20
work for anything else than man. Of course , as I have said before ,=20
it is easier to see in state authority the mere formal mechanism of an=20
organization than the sovereign embodiment of a nationality=E2=80=99s in=C2=
=AC=20
stinct of self-preservation on earth. For in the one case the state,=20
as well as state authority, is for these weak minds a purpose in it=C2=AC=
=20
self, while in the other, it is only a mighty weapon in the service=20
of the great, eternal life struggle for existence, a weapon to which=20
everyone must submit because it is not formal and mechanical,=20
but the expression of a common will for preserving life.=20

Hence, in the struggle for our new conception, which is entirely=20
in keeping with the primal meaning of things, we shall find few=20
fellow warriors in a society which not only is physically senile but,=20
sad to say, usually, mentally as well. Only exceptions, old men=20
with young hearts and fresh minds, will come to us from those=20
classes, never those who see the ultimate meaning of their life=20
ta,sk in the preservation of an existing condition.=20

We are confronted by the endless army, not so much of the=20
deliberately bad as of the mentally lazy and indifferent, including=20
those with a stake in the preservation of the present condition.=20
But precisely in this apparent hopelessness of our gigantic strug=C2=AC=20
gle lies the greatness of our task and also the possibility of our=20
success. The battle-cry which either scares away the small spirits=20
at the very start, or soon makes them despair, will be the signal=20
for the assemblage of real fighting natures. And this we must see=20
clearly: If in a people a certain amount of the highest energy and=20
active force seems concentrated upon one goal and hence is definitively=20
removed from the inertia of the broad masses , this small percentage=20
has risen to be master over the entire number. World history is made=20
by minorities when this minority of number embodies the majority=20
of will and determination.=20

What , therefore , may appear as a difficulty today is in reality=20
the premise for our victory. Precisely in the greatness and the diffi=C2=AC=
=20
culties of our task lies the probability that only the best fighters will=
=20
step forward to struggle for it. And in this selection lies the guaranty=20
of success .=20


400=20


Mein Kampe=20


In general, Nature herself usually makes certain corrective deci-=20
sions with regard to the racial purity of earthly creatures. She=20
has little love for bastards. Especially the first products of such=20
cross-breeding, say in the third, fourth, and fifth generation, suffer=20
bitterly. Not only is the value of the originally highest element of=20
the cross-breeding taken from them, but with their lack of blood=20
unity they lack also unity of will-power and determination to live.=20
In all critical moments in which the racially unified being makes=20
correct, that is, unified decisions, the racially divided one will be=C2=AC=
=20
come uncertain; that is, he will arrive at half measures. Taken=20
together, this means not only a certain inferiority of the racially=20
divided being compared with the racially unified one, but in prac=C2=AC=20
tice also the possibility of a more rapid decline. In innumerable=20
cases where race holds up, the bastard breaks down. In this, we must=20
see the correction of Nature. But often she goes even further.=20
She limits the possibility of propagation. Thereby she prevents=20
the fertility of continued crossings altogether and thus causes=20
them to die out.=20

If, for example, an individual specimen of a certain race were to=20
enter into a union with a racially lower specimen, the result would=20
at first be a lowering of the standard in itself; but, in addition,=20
there would be a weakening of the offspring as compared to the=20
environment that had remained racially unmixed. If an influx=20
of further blood from the highest race were prevented entirely,=20
the bastards, if they continued mutually to cross, would either=20
die out because their power of resistance had been wisely dimin=C2=AC=20
ished by Nature, or in the course of many millenniums a new mix=C2=AC=20
ture would form in which the original individual elements would=20
be completely blended by the thousandfold crossing and therefore=20
no longer recognizable. Thus a new nationality would have=20
formed with a certain herd resistance, but, compared to the high=C2=AC=20
est race participating in the first crossing, seriously reduced in=20
spiritual and cultural stature. But in this last case, moreover,=20
the hybrid product would succumb in the mutual struggle for=20
existence as long as a higher racial entity, which has remained=20
unmixed, is still present as an opponent. All the herd solidarity=20


Natural Regeneration oe Races=20


401=20


of this new people, formed in the course of thousands of years,=20
would, in consequence of the general lowering of the racial level=20
and the resultant diminution of spiritual elasticity and creative=20
ability, not suffice victoriously to withstand the struggle with an=20
equally unified, but spiritually and culturally superior race.=20

Hence we can establish the following valid statement:=20

Every racial crossing leads inevitably sooner or later to the decline=20
of the hybrid product as long as the higher element of this crossing=20
is itself still existent in any kind of racial unity. The danger for=20
the hybrid product is eliminated only at the moment when the=20
last higher racial element is bastardized.=20

This is a basis for a natural, even though slow, process of re=C2=AC=20
generation, which gradually eliminates racial poisonings as long=20
as a basic stock of racially pure elements is still present and a fur=C2=AC=
=20
ther bastardization does not take place.=20

Such a process can begin of its own accord in creatures with a=20
strong racial instinct, who have only been thrown off the track of=20
normal, racially pure reproduction by special circumstances or=20
some special compulsion. As soon as this condition of compulsion=20
is ended, the part which has still remained pure will at once strive=20
again for mating among equals, thus calling a halt to further mix=C2=AC=20
ture. The results of bastardization spontaneously recede to the=20
background, unless their number has increased so infinitely that=20
serious resistance on the part of those who have remained ra=C2=AC=20
cially pure is out of the question.=20

Man, once he has lost his instinct and fails to recognize the=20
obligation imposed upon him by Nature, is on the whole not justi=C2=AC=20
fied in hoping for such a correction on the part of Nature as long=20
as he has not replaced his lost instinct by perceptive knowledge;=20
this knowledge must then perform the required work of compen=C2=AC=20
sation. Yet the danger is very great that the man who has once=20
grown blind will keep tearing down the racial barriers more and=20
more, until at length even the last remnant of his best part is lost.=20
Then in reality there remains nothing but a unified mash, such=20
as the famous world reformers of our days idealize; but in a short=20
time it would expel all ideals from this world. Indeed: a great=20


402=20


Mein Kampf=20


herd could he formed in this way; a herd beast can be brewed from all=20
sorts of ingredients. bat a man who will be a culture-bearer, or even=20
better, a culture-founder and culture-creator, never arises from such a=20
mixture. The mission of humanity could then be looked upon as=20
finished.=20

Anyone who does not want the earth to move toward this con=C2=AC=20
dition must convert himself to the conception that it is the func=C2=AC=20
tion above all of the Germanic states first and foremost to call a=20
fundamental halt to any further bastardization.=20

The generation of our present notorious weaklings will ob=C2=AC=20
viously cry out against this, and moan and complain about as=C2=AC=20
saults on the holiest human rights. No, there is only one holiest=20
human right, and this right is at the same time the holiest obligation,=20
to wit: to see to it that the blood is preserved pure and, by preserving=20
the best humanity, to create the possibility of a nobler development of=20
these beings.=20

A folkish state must therefore begin by raising marriage from the=20
level of a continuous defilement of the race, and give it the consecra=C2=
=AC=20
tion of an institution which is called upon to produce images of the=20
Lord and not monstrosities halfway between man and ape.=20

The protest against this on so-called humane grounds is particu=C2=AC=20
larly ill-suited to an era which on the one hand gives every de=C2=AC=20
praved degenerate the possibility of propagating, but which bur=C2=AC=20
dens the products themselves, as well as their contemporaries,=20
with untold suffering, while on the other hand every drug store=20
and our very street peddlers offer the means for the prevention=20
of births for sale even to the healthiest parents. In this present-=20
day state of law and order in the eyes of its representatives, this=20
brave, bourgeois-national society, the prevention of the procre=C2=AC=20
ative faculty in sufferers from syphilis, tuberculosis, hereditary=20
diseases, cripples, and cretins is a crime, while the actual sup=C2=AC=20
pression of the procreative faculty in millions of the very best=20
people is not regarded as anything bad and does not offend=20
against the morals of this hypocritical society, but is rather a=20
benefit to its short-sighted mental laziness. For otherwise these=20
people would at least be forced to rack their brains about pro-=20

serve the same function with regard to the coming generation.=20

How boundlessly unideal and ignoble is this whole system!=20
People no longer bother to breed the best for posterity, but let=20
things slide along as best they can. If our churches also sin=20
against the image of the Lord, whose importance they still so=20
highly emphasize, it is entirely because of the line of their present=20
activity which speaks always of the spirit and lets its bearer, the=20
man, degenerate into a depraved proletarian. Afterwards, of=20
course, they make foolish faces and are full of amazement at the=20
small effect of the Christian faith in their own country, at the=20
terrible =E2=80=98 godlessness/ at this physically botched and hence=20
spiritually degenerate rabble, and try with the Church=E2=80=99s Blessing,=
=20
to make up for it by success with the Hottentots and Zulu Kaffirs.=20
While our European peoples, thank the Lord, fall into a condition=20
of physical and moral leprosy, the pious missionary wanders off=20
to Central Africa and sets up Negro missions until there, too, our=20
=E2=80=98higher culture=E2=80=99 turns healthy, though primitive and inferi=
or,=20
human beings into a rotten brood of bastards.=20

It would be more in keeping with the intention of the noblest=20
man in this world if our two Christian churches, instead of an=C2=AC=20
noying Negroes with missions which they neither desire nor un=C2=AC=20
derstand, would kindly, but in all seriousness, teach our European=20
humanity that where parents are not healthy it is a deed pleasing=20
to God to take pity on a poor little healthy orphan child and give=20
him father and mother, than themselves to give birth to a sick=20
child who will only bring unhappiness and suffering on himself=20
and the rest of the world.=20

The folkish state must make up for what everyone else today=20
has neglected in this field. It must set race in the center of all life.=20
It must take care to keep it pure . It must declare the child to he the=20
most precious treasure of the people. It must see to it that only the=20
healthy beget children; that there is only one disgrace: despite one=E2=80=
=99s=20
own sickness and deficiencies , to bring children into the world , and=20
one highest honor: to renounce doing so. And conversely it must=20


404=20


Mein Kampf=20


considered reprehensible: to withhold healthy children from the=20
nation. Here the state must act as the guardian of a millennial future=20
in the face of which the wishes and the selfishness of the individual=20
must appear as nothing and submit. It must put the most modern=20
medical means in the service of this knowledge. It must declare unfit=20
for propagation all who are in any way visibly sick or who have in=C2=AC=20
herited a disease and can therefore pass it on, and put this into actual=20
practice. Conversely, it must take care that the fertility of the healthy=
=20
woman is not limited by the financial irresponsibility of a state regime=20
which turns the blessing of children into a curse for the parents. It=20
must put an end to that lazy, nay criminal, indifference with which=20
the social premises for a fecund family are treated today, and must=20
instead feel itself to be the highest guardian of this most precious=20
blessing of a people. Its concern belongs more to the child than to the=20
adult.=20

Those who are physically and mentally unhealthy and unworthy=20
must not perpetuate their suffering in the body of their children. In=20
this the folkish state must perform the most gigantic educational task.=20
And some day this will seem to be a greater deed than the most victori=C2=
=AC=20
ous wars of our present bourgeois era. By education it must teach the=20
individual that it is no disgrace, but only a misfortune deserving of=20
pity, to be sick and weakly, but that it is a crime and hence at the same=
=20
time a disgrace to dishonor one=E2=80=99s misfortune by one=E2=80=99s own e=
gotism in=20
burdening innocent creatures with it; that by comparison it bespeaks=20
a nobility of highest idealism and the most admirable humanity if=20
the innocently sick, renouncing a child of his own, bestows his love=20
and tenderness upon a poor, unknown young scion of his own na=C2=AC=20
tionality, who with his health promises to become some day a powerf ul=20
member of a powerful community. And in this educational work the=20
state must perform the purely intellectual complement of its practical=20
activity. It must act in this sense without regard to understanding or=20
lack of understanding, approval or disapproval.=20

A prevention of the faculty and opportunity to procreate on=20
the part of the physically degenerate and mentally sick, over a=20
period of only six hundred years, would not only free humanity=20
from an immeasurable misfortune, but would lead to a recovery=20


Folkish State and Racial Hygiene=20


405=20


which today seems scarcely conceivable. If the fertility of the=20
healthiest bearers of the nationality is thus consciously and=20
systematically promoted, the result will be a race which at least=20
will have eliminated the germs of our present physical and hence=20
spiritual decay.=20

For once a people and a state have started on this path, at=C2=AC=20
tention will automatically be directed on increasing the racially=20
most valuable nucleus of the people and its fertility, in order=20
ultimately to let the entire nationality partake of the blessing of=20
a highly bred racial stock.=20

The way to do this is above all for the state not to leave the=20
settlement of newly acquired territories to chance, but to subject=20
it to special norms. Specially constituted racial commissions=20
must issue settlement certificates to individuals. For this, how=C2=AC=20
ever, definite racial purity must be established. It will thus=20
gradually become possible to found border colonies whose in=C2=AC=20
habitants are exclusively bearers of the highest racial purity and=20
hence of the highest racial efficiency. This will make them a=20
precious national treasure to the entire nation; their growth must=20
fill every single national comrade with pride and confidence, for=20
in them lies the germ for a final, great future development of our=20
own people, nay =E2=80=94 of humanity.=20

In the folkish state , finally , the folkish philosophy of life must=20
succeed in bringing about that nobler age in which men no longer are=20
concerned with breeding dogs , horses , and cats , but in elevating man=20
himself , an age in which the one knowingly and silently renounces ,=20
the other joyfully sacrifices and gives.=20

That this is possible may not be denied in a world where hun=C2=AC=20
dreds and hundreds of thousands of people voluntarily submit to=20
celibacy, obligated and bound by nothing except the injunction=20
of the Church.=20

Should the same renunciation not be possible if this injunction=20
is replaced by the admonition finally to put an end to the constant=20
and continuous original sin of racial poisoning, and to give the=20
Almighty Creator beings such as He Himself created?=20

Of course, the miserable army of our present-day shopkeepers=20


406=20


Mein Kampe=20


will never understand this. They will laugh at it or shrug their=20
crooked shoulders and moan forth their eternal excuse: =E2=80=98That=20
would be very nice in itself, but it canT be done!=E2=80=99 True, it can no=
=20
longer be done with you, your world isn=E2=80=99t fit for it! You know=20
but one concern: your personal life, and one God: your money!=20
But we are not addressing ourselves to you, we are appealing to=20
the great army of those who are so poor that their personal life=20
cannot mean the highest happiness in the world; to those who do=20
not see the ruling principle of their existence in gold, but in other=20
gods. Above all we appeal to the mighty army of our German=20
youth. They are growing up at a great turning point and the=20
evils brought about by the inertia and indifference of their fa=C2=AC=20
thers will force them into struggle. Some day the German youth=20
will either be the builder of a new folkish state, or they will be the=20
last witness of total collapse, the end of the bourgeois world.=20

For if a generation suffers from faults which it recognizes, even=20
admits, but nevertheless, as occurs today in our bourgeois world,=20
contents itself with the cheap excuse that there is nothing to be=20
done about it =E2=80=94 such a society is doomed. The characteristic=20
thing about our bourgeois world is precisely that it can no longer=20
deny the ailments as such. It must admit that much is rotten=20
and bad, but it no longer finds the determination to rebel against=20
the evil, to muster the force of a people of sixty or seventy mil=C2=AC=20
lions with embittered energy, and oppose it to the danger. On=20
the contrary: if this is done elsewhere, silly comments are made=20
about it, and they attempt from a distance at least to prove the=20
theoretical impossibility of the method and declare success to be=20
inconceivable. And no reason is too absurd to serve as a prop for=20
their own dwarfishness and mental attitude. If, for example, a=20
whole continent finally declares war on alcoholic poisoning, in=20
order to redeem a people from the clutches of this devastating=20
vice, our European bourgeois world has no other comment for it=20
than a meaningless staring and head-shaking, a supercilious ridi=C2=AC=20
cule =E2=80=94 which is particularly suited to this most ridiculous of all=
=20
societies. But if all this is to no avail, and if somewhere in the=20
world the sublime, inviolable old routine is opposed, and even=20


Lack of Energy in the Bourgeoisie=20


407=20


with success, then, as said before, the success at least must be=20
doubted and deprecated; and here they do not even shun to raise=20
bourgeois-moral arguments against a struggle which strives to=20
abolish the greatest immorality.=20

No, we must none of us make any mistake about all of this:=20
our present bourgeoisie has become worthless for every exalted=20
task of mankind, simply because it is without quality and no=20
good; and what makes it no good is not so much in my opinion=20
any deliberate malice as an incredible indolence and everything=20
that springs from it. And therefore those political clubs which=20
carry on under the collective concept of =E2=80=98bourgeois parties=E2=80=
=99 have=20
long ceased to be anything else but associations representing the=20
interests of certain professional groups and classes, and their=20
highest task has ceased to be anything but the best possible selfish=20
defense of their interests. It is obvious that such a political=20
=E2=80=98bourgeois=E2=80=99 guild is good for anything sooner than struggle=
; espe=C2=AC=20
cially if the opposing side does not consist of cautious pepper=20
sacks [small tradesmen], but of proletarian masses, incited to ex=C2=AC=20
tremes and determined to do their worst.=20


# # #=20

If as the first task of the state in the service and for the welfare=20
of its nationality we recognize the preservation, care, and de=C2=AC=20
velopment of the best racial elements, it is natural that this care=20
must not only extend to the birth of every little national and=20
racial comrade, but that it must educate the young offspring to=20
become a valuable link in the chain of future reproduction.=20

And as in general the precondition for spiritual achievement=20
lies in the racial quality of the human material at hand, education=20
in particular must first of all consider and promote physical=20
health; for taken in the mass, a healthy, forceful spirit will be=20
found only in a healthy and forceful body. The fact that geniuses=20
are sometimes physically not very fit, or actually sick, is no argu=C2=AC=
=20
ment against this. Here we have to do with exceptions which =E2=80=94=E2=96=
=A0=20


408=20


Mein Kampe=20


as everywhere =E2=80=94 only confirm the rule. But if the mass of a=20
people consists of physical degenerates, from this swamp a really=20
great spirit will very seldom arise. In any case his activity will=20
not meet with great success. The degenerate rabble will either=20
not understand him at all, or it will be so weakened in will that it=20
can no longer follow the lofty flight of such an eagle.=20

Realizing this , the folkish state must not adjust its entire educa=C2=AC=
=20
tional work primarily to the inoculation of mere knowledge , hut to=20
the breeding of absolutely healthy bodies. The training of menial=20
abilities is only secondary. And here again, first place must be=20
taken by the development of character, especially the promotion of=20
will-power and determination, combined with the training of joy in=20
responsibility, and only in last place comes scientific schooling.=20

Here the folkish state must proceed from the assumption that=20
a man of little scientific education but physically healthy, with a good ,=
=20
firm character, imbued with the joy of determination and will-power ,=20
is more valuable for the national community than a clever weakling.=20
A people of scholars, if they are physically degenerate, weak-=20
willed and cowardly pacifists, will not storm the heavens, indeed=20
they will not even be able to safeguard their existence on this=20
earth. In the hard struggle of destiny the man who knows least=20
seldom succumbs, but always he who from his knowledge draws=20
the weakest consequences and is most lamentable in transforming=20
them into action. Here too, finally, a certain harmony must be=20
present. A decayed body is not made the least more aesthetic by a=20
brilliant mind, indeed the highest intellectual training could not=20
be justified if its bearers were at the same time physically de=C2=AC=20
generate and crippled, weak-willed, wavering and cowardly in=C2=AC=20
dividuals. What makes the Greek ideal of beauty a model is the=20
wonderful combination of the most magnificent physical beauty=20
with brilliant mind and noblest soul.=20

If Moltke=E2=80=99s saying, =E2=80=98 In the long run only the able man has=
 luck/=20
is anywhere applicable, it is surely to the relation between body=20
and mind; the mind, too, if it is healthy, will as a rule and in the=20
long run dwell only in the healthy body.=20

Physical training in the folkish state, therefore, is not an affair=20


Educational Principles oe the Folkish State 409=20

of the individual, and not even a matter which primarily regards=20
the parents and only secondly or thirdly interests the community;=20
it is a requirement for the self-preservation of the nationality,=20
represented and protected by the state. Just as the state, as far=20
as purely scientific education is concerned, even today interferes=20
with the individual=E2=80=99s right of self-determination and upholds the=
=20
right of the totality toward him by subjecting the child to com=C2=AC=20
pulsory education without asking whether the parents want it or=20
not =E2=80=94 in far greater measure the folkish state must some day=20
enforce its authority against the individual=E2=80=99s ignorance or lack of=
=20
understanding in questions regarding the preservation of the=20
nationality. It must so organize its educational work that the=20
young bodies are treated expediently in their earliest childhood=20
and obtain the necessary steeling for later life. It must above all=20
prevent the rearing of a generation of hothouse plants.=20

This work of care and education must begin with the young=20
mother. Just as it became possible in the course of careful work=20
over a period of decades to achieve antiseptic cleanliness in child=C2=AC=
=20
birth and reduce puerperal fever to a few cases, it must and will=20
be possible, by a thorough training of nurses and mothers them=C2=AC=20
selves, to achieve a treatment of the child in his first years that=20
will serve as an excellent basis for future development.=20

The school as such in a folkish state must create infinitely more=20
free time for physical training. It is not permissible to burden=20
young brains with a ballast only a fraction of which they retain,=20
as experience shows, not to mention the fact that as a rule it is=20
unnecessary trifles that stick instead of essentials, since the young=20
child cannot undertake a sensible sifting of the material that has=20
been funneled into him. If today, even in the curriculum of the=20
secondary schools, gymnastics gets barely two hours a week and=20
participation in it is not even obligatory, but is left open to the=20
individual, that is a gross incongruity compared to the purely=20
mental training. Not a day should go by in which the young=20
man does not receive one hour=E2=80=99s physical training in the morning=20
and one in the afternoon, covering every type of sport and gym=C2=AC=20
nastics. And here one sport in particular must not be forgotten.=20


410=20


Mein Kampf=20


which in the eyes of many =E2=80=98 folkish =E2=80=99 minded people is cons=
idered=20
vulgar and undignified: boxing. It is incredible what false opin=C2=AC=20
ions are widespread in =E2=80=98 educated =E2=80=99 circles. It is regarded=
 as natural=20
and honorable that a young man should learn to fence and pro=C2=AC=20
ceed to fight duels right and left, but if he boxes, it is supposed to=20
be vulgar! Why? There is no sport that so much as this one pro=C2=AC=20
motes the spirit of attack, demands lightning decisions, and=20
trains the body in steel dexterity. It is no more vulgar for two=20
young men to fight out a difference of opinion with their fists than=20
with a piece of whetted iron. It is not less noble if a man who has=20
been attacked defends himself against his assailant with his fists,=20
instead of running away and yelling for a policeman. But above=20
all, the young, healthy body must also learn to suffer blows. Of=20
course this may seem wild to the eyes of our present spiritual=20
fighters. But it is not the function of the folkish state to breed a=20
colony of peaceful aesthetes and physical degenerates. Not in=20
the respectable shopkeeper or virtuous old maid does it see its=20
ideal of humanity, but in the defiant embodiment of manly=20
strength and in women who are able to bring men into the=20
world.=20

And so sport does not exist only to make the individual strong,=20
agile and bold; it should also toughen him and teach him to bear=20
hardships.=20

If our entire intellectual upper crust had not been brought up=20
so exclusively on upper-class etiquette; if instead they had learned=20
boxing thoroughly, a German revolution of pimps, deserters, and=20
such-like rabble would never have been possible; for what gave=20
this revolution success was not the bold, courageous energy of the=20
revolutionaries, but the cowardly, wretched indecision of those=20
who led the state and were responsible for it. The fact is that our=20
whole intellectual leadership had received only =E2=80=98intellectual=E2=80=
=99=20
education and hence could not help but be defenseless the moment=20
not intellectual weapons but the crowbar went into action on=20
the opposing side. All this was possible only because as a matter=20
of principle especially our higher educational system did not=20
train men, but officials, engineers, technicians, chemists, jurists,=20


Suggestive Force of Self-Confidence=20


411=20


journalists, and to keep these intellectuals from dying out,=20
professors.=20

Our intellectual leadership always performed brilliant feats,=20
while our leadership in the matter of will-power usually remained=20
beneath all criticism.=20

Certainly it will not be possible to turn a man of basically=20
cowardly disposition into a courageous man by education, but=20
just as certainly a man who in himself is not cowardly will be=20
paralyzed in the development of his qualities if due to deficiencies=20
in his education he is from the very start inferior to his neighbor=20
in physical strength and dexterity. To what extent the conviction=20
of physical ability promotes a man=E2=80=99s sense of courage, even=20
arouses his spirit of attack, can best be judged by the example of=20
the army. Here, too, essentially, we have to deal not solely with=20
heroes but with the broad average. But the superior training of=20
the German soldier in peacetime inoculated the whole gigantic=20
organism with that suggestive faith in its own superiority to an=20
extent which even our foes had not considered possible. For the=20
immortal offensive spirit and offensive courage achieved in the=20
long months of midsummer and autumn 1914 by the forward=C2=AC=20
sweeping German armies was the result of that untiring train=C2=AC=20
ing which in the long, long years of peace obtained the most=20
incredible achievement often out of frail bodies, and thus culti=C2=AC=20
vated that self-confidence which was not lost even in the terror=20
of the greatest battles.=20

Particularly our German people which today lies broken and de=C2=AC=20
fenseless , exposed to the kicks of all the world , needs that suggestive=
=20
force that lies in self-confidence. This self-confidence must be in=C2=AC=
=20
culcated in the young national comrade from childhood on. His=20
whole education and training must be so ordered as to give him the=20
conviction that he is absolutely superior to others. Through his=20
physical strength and dexterity , he must recover his faith in the in=C2=AC=
=20
vincibility of his whole people. For what formerly led the German=20
army to victory was the sum of the confidence which each individual=20
had in himself and all together in their leadership. What will raise=20
the German people up again is confidence in the possibility of regain-=20


412=20


Mein Kampf=20


ing its freedom. And this conviction can only he the final product of=20
the same feeling in millions of individuals.=20

Here, too, we must not deceive ourselves:=20

Immense was the collapse of our people, and the exertion=20
needed to end this misery some day will have to be just as im=C2=AC=20
mense. Anyone who thinks that our present bourgeois education=20
for peace and order will give our people the strength some day=20
to smash the present world order, which means our doom, and to=20
hurl the links of our slavery into the face of our enemies, is bit=C2=AC=20
terly mistaken. Only by super-abundance of national will-power,=20
thirst for freedom, and highest passion, will we compensate for=20
what we formerly lacked.=20


TV* 7T=20


The clothing of our youth should also be adapted to this pur=C2=AC=20
pose. It is truly miserable to behold how our youth even now is=20
subjected, to a fashion madness which helps to reverse the sense=20
of the old saying: =E2=80=98 Clothes make the man =E2=80=99 into something =
truly=20
catastrophic.=20

Especially in the youth, dress must be put into the service of=20
education. The boy who in summer runs around in long stove=C2=AC=20
pipe trousers, and covered up to the neck, loses through his cloth=C2=AC=20
ing alone a stimulus for his physical training. For we must ex=C2=AC=20
ploit ambition and, we may as well calmly admit it, vanity as=20
well. Not vanity about fine clothes which everyone cannot buy,=20
but vanity about a beautiful, well-formed body which everyone=20
can help to build.=20

This is also expedient for later life. The girl should get to know=20
her beau. If physical beauty were today not forced entirely into=20
the background by our foppish fashions, the seduction of hun=C2=AC=20
dreds of thousands of girls by bow-legged, repulsive Jewish bas=C2=AC=20
tards would not be possible. This, too, is in the interest of the=20
nation: that the most beautiful bodies should find one another,=20
and so help to give the nation new beauty.=20


Supervision: School and Military Service 413=20

Today, of course, all this is more necessary than ever, because=20
there is no military training, and so the sole institution is excluded=20
which in peacetime compensated at least in part for what was=20
neglected by the rest of our educational system. And there, too,=20
success was to be sought, not only in the training of the individual=20
as such, but in the influence it exerted on the relations between=20
the two sexes. The young girl preferred the soldier to the non=C2=AC=20
soldier.=20

The folkish state must not only carry through and supervise=20
physical training in the official school years; in the post-school=20
period as well it must make sure that, as long as a boy is in process=20
of physical development, this development turns out to his bene=C2=AC=20
fit. It is an absurdity to believe that with the end of the school=20
period the state=E2=80=99s right to supervise its young citizens suddenly=
=20
ceases, but returns at the military age. This right is a duty and=20
as such is equally present at all times. Only the present-day state=20
having no interest in healthy people has neglected this duty in a=20
criminal fashion. It lets present-day youth go to the dogs on=20
the streets and in brothels, instead of taking them in hand and=20
continuing their physical education until the day when they grow=20
up into a healthy man and a healthy woman.=20

In what form the state carries on this training is beside the=20
point today; the important thing is that it should do so and seek=20
the ways and means that serve this purpose. The folkish state=20
will have to look on post-school physical training as well as in=C2=AC=20
tellectual education as a state function, and foster them through=20
state institutions. This education in its broad outlines can serve=20
as a preparation for future military service. The army will not=20
have to teach the young men the fundamentals of the most ele=C2=AC=20
mentary drill-book as hitherto, and it will not get recruits of the=20
present type; no, it will only have to transform a young man who=20
has already received flawless physical preparation into a soldier.=20

In the folkish state, therefore, the army will no longer have to=20
teach the individual how to walk and to stand; it will be the last=20
and highest school of patriotic education. In the army the young=20
recruit will receive the necessary training in arms, and at the same=20


414=20


Mein Kampf=20

time he will receive a further moulding for any other future=20
career. But in the forefront of military training will stand what=20
has to be regarded as the highest merit of the old army: in this=20
school the boy must be transformed into a man; in this school he=20
must not only learn to obey, but must thereby acquire a basis for=20
commanding later. He must learn to be silent not only when he is=20
justly blamed but must also learn, when necessary, to bear in=C2=AC=20
justice in silence.=20

Furthermore, reinforced by faith in his own strength, filled=20
with the force of a commonly experienced esprit de corps , he must=20
become convinced of the invincibility of his nationality.=20

After the conclusion of his military service, two documents=20
should be issued: His citizen=E2=80=99s diploma , a legal document which=20
admits him to public activity, and his health certificate, confirm=C2=AC=20
ing his physical health for marriage.=20


# # # ,=20

Analogous to the education of the boy, the folkish state can=20
conduct the education of the girl from the same viewpoint. There,=20
too, the chief emphasis must be laid on physical training, and=20
only subsequently on the promotion of spiritual and finally in=C2=AC=20
tellectual values. The goal of female education must invariably=20
be the future mother.=20


# # #=20

Only secondarily must the folkish state promote the develop=C2=AC=20
ment of the character in every way.=20

Assuredly the most essential features of character are funda=C2=AC=20
mentally preformed in the individual: the man of egotistic nature=20
is and remains so forever, just as the idealist in the bottom of his=20
heart will always be an idealist. But between the fully distinct=20
characters there are millions that seem vague and unclear. The=20


Training in Silence=20


415=20


born criminal is and remains a criminal; but numerous people in=20
whom there is only a certain tendency toward the criminal can by=20
sound education still become valuable members of a national=20
community; while conversely, through bad education, wavering=20
characters can turn into really bad elements.=20

How often, during the War, did we hear the complaint that=20
our people were so little able to be silentl How hard this made it=20
to withhold even important secrets from the knowledge of our=20
enemies! But ask yourself this question: What, before the War,=20
did German education do to teach the individual silence? Even*=20
in school, sad to say, wasn=E2=80=99t the little informer sometimes pre=C2=
=AC=20
ferred to his more silent schoolmates? Was not and is not in=C2=AC=20
forming regarded as praiseworthy =E2=80=98frankness,=E2=80=99 discretion as=
=20
reprehensible obstinacy? Was any effort whatever made to repre=C2=AC=20
sent discretion as a manly and precious virtue? No, for in the=20
eyes of our present school system these are trifles. But these=20
trifles cost the state countless millions in court costs, for ninety=20
per cent of all slander and similar suits have arisen only through=20
lack of discretion. Irresponsibly dropped remarks are gossiped=20
along just as frivolously, our national economy is constantly=20
harmed by the frivolous revelation of important manufacturing=20
processes, etc.; in fact, all our secret preparations for national=20
defense are rendered illusory since the people simply have not=20
learned how to be silent but pass everything on. This talkative=C2=AC=20
ness can lead to the loss of battles and thus contribute materially=20
to the unfavorable issue of the conflict. Here, again, we must=20
realize that mature age cannot do what has not been practiced=20
in youth. And this is the place to say that a teacher, for instance,=20
must on principle not try to obtain knowledge of silly children=E2=80=99s=
=20
tricks by cultivating loathsome tattle-tales. Youth has its own=20
state, it has a certain closed solidarity toward the grown-up, and=20
this is perfectly natural. The ten year-old=E2=80=99s bond with his play=C2=
=AC=20
mate of the same age is more natural and greater than his bond=20
with grown-ups. A boy who snitches on his comrade practices=20
treason and thus betrays a mentality which, harshly expressed=20
and enlarged, is the exact equivalent of treason to one=E2=80=99s country.=
=20


416=20


Mein Kampf=20


Such a boy can by no means be regarded as a =E2=80=98good, decent =E2=80=99=
 child;=20
no, he is a boy of undesirable character. The teacher may find it=20
convenient to make use of such vices for enhancing his authority,=20
but in this way he sow r s in the youthful heart the germ of a men=C2=AC=20
tality the later effect of which may be catastrophic. More than=20
once, a little informer has grown up to be a big scoundrel!=20

This is only one example among many. Today the conscious=20
development of good, noble traits of character in school is practi=C2=AC=20
cally nil. In the future far greater emphasis must be laid on this.=20
* Loyalty, spirit of sacrifice, discretion are virtues that a great nation=
=20
absolutely needs, and their cultivation and development in school=20
are more important than some of the things which today fill out=20
our curriculums. The discouragement of whining complaints, of=20
bawling, etc., also belongs in this province. If a system of educa=C2=AC=20
tion forgets to teach the child in early years that sufferings and=20
adversity must be borne in silence, it has no right to be surprised=20
if later at a critical hour, when a man stands at the front, for ex=C2=AC=
=20
ample, the entire postal service is used for nothing but transport=C2=AC=20
ing whining letters of mutual complaint. If at the public schools=20
a little less knowledge had been funneled into our youth and more=20
self-control, this would have been richly rewarded in the years=20
from 1915 to 1918.=20

And so the folkish state, in its educational work, must side=20
by side with physical culture set the highest value precisely on=20
the training of character. Numerous moral weaknesses in our=20
present national body, if they cannot be entirely eliminated by=20
this kind of education, can at least be very much attenuated.=20


# # #=20


Of the highest importance is the training of will-power and deter=C2=AC=20
mination, plus the cultivation of joy in responsibility.=20

In the army the principle once held good that any command is=20
better than none; related to youth this means primarily that any=20
answer is better than none. The dread of giving no answer for=20


417=20


Cultivation of Joy and Responsibility=20

fear of saying something wrong must be considered more hu=C2=AC=20
miliating than an incorrectly given answer. Starting from this=20
most primitive basis, youth should be trained in such a way that=20
it acquires courage for action.=20

People have often complained that in the days of November=20
and December, 1918, every single authority failed, that from the=20
monarchs down to the last divisional commander, no one was=20
able to summon up the strength for an independent decision.=20
This terrible fact is the handwriting on the wall for our edu=C2=AC=20
cational system, for this cruel catastrophe expressed, hugely=20
magnified, what was generally present on a small scale. It is this=20
lack of will and not the lack of weapons which today makes us=20
incapable of any serious resistance. It sits rooted in our whole=20
people, prevents any decision with which a risk is connected, as=20
though the greatness of a deed did not consist precisely in the=20
risk. Without suspecting it, a German general succeeded in find=C2=AC=20
ing the classic formula for this miserable spinelessness: =E2=80=98I act on=
ly=20
if I can count on fifty-one per cent likelihood of success.=E2=80=99 In the=
se=20
( fifty-one per cent=E2=80=99 lies the tragedy of the German collapse; any=
=C2=AC=20
one who demands of Fate a guaranty of success, automatically=20
renounces all idea of a heroic deed. For this lies in undertaking a=20
step which may lead to success, in the full awareness of the mortal=20
danger inherent in a state of affairs. A cancer victim whose=20
death is otherwise certain does not have to figure out fifty-one=20
per cent in order to risk an operation. And if the operation=20
promises only half a per cent likelihood of cure, a courageous=20
man will risk it; otherwise he has no right to whimper for his=20
life.=20

The plague of our present-day cowardly lack of will and de=C2=AC=20
termination is, all in all, mainly the result of our basically faulty=20
education of youth, whose devastating effect extends to later life=20
and finds its ultimate crowning conclusion in the lack of civil=20
courage in our leading statesmen.=20

In the same line falls the present-day flagrant cowardice in the=20
face of responsibility. Here, too, the error begins in the education=20
of youth, goes on to permeate all public life, and finds its im-=20

predicted for many a youth for qualities which w^ould be of in=C2=AC=20
estimable value if they constituted the common possession of a=20
whole people.=20

Just as the folkish state must some day devote the highest attention=20
to the training of the will and force of decision , it must from an early=
=20
age implant joy in responsibility and courage for confession in the=20
hearts of youth. Only if it recognizes this necessity in its full im=C2=AC=

port will it finally, after an educational work enduring for cen=C2=AC=20

# * #=20

The scientific school training which today is really the begin=C2=AC=20
ning and end of all state educational work can with only slight=20
changes be taken over by the folkish state. These changes lie in=20
three fields.=20

In the first place the youthful brain should in general not be=20
burdened with things ninety-five per cent of which it cannot use and=20
hence forgets again. Particularly, the curriculum of the elementary=20
and intermediate schools is today a mongrel; in many cases, the=20
material to be learned in the various subjects is so swollen that=20
only a fraction of it remains in the head of the individual pupil,=20
and only a fraction of this abundance can find application, while=20
on the other hand it is not adequate for the man working and=20
earning his living in a definite field. Take, for example, the=20
average government official, graduated from the Gymnasium or=20


No Overloading of the Brain=20


419=20


the superior Realschule, at the age of thirty-five or forty, and=20
examine him in the school learning that was once so painfully=20
drummed into him. How little of all the stuff that was once=20
funneied into him is still present! To be sure, you will get the=20
answer: =E2=80=98Well, the mass of material learned then was not in=C2=AC=
=20
tended only for the future possession of varied knowledge, but=20
also for training mental receptivity, the power of thought and=20
especially the memory. This is partly correct. Yet there is a=20
danger in having the youthful brain flooded with so many im=C2=AC=20
pressions which only in the rarest cases it is able to master, and=20
whose various elements it neither can sift nor evaluate accord=C2=AC=20
ing to their greater or lesser importance; and besides, as a rule,=20
not the non-essential but the essential is forgotten and sacrificed.=20
Thus the main purpose of learning so much is again lost; for it=20
cannot consist after all in inducing learning power in the brain=20
by an unmeasured heaping up of material, but must be to give=20
the future man that store of knowledge which the individual=20
needs and which through him in turn benefits the community.=20
And this becomes illusory if the man, in consequence of the=20
superabundance of the material forced on him in youth, later=20
either possesses it not at all or has long since lost the very essen=C2=AC=
=20
tials. It is impossible to understand, for example, why millions=20
of people in the course of the years must learn two or three=20
foreign languages only a fraction of which they can make use of=20
later and hence most of them forget entirely, for of a hundred=20
thousand pupils who learn French for example, barely two thou=C2=AC=20
sand will have a serious use for this knowledge later, while=20
ninety-eight thousand in the whole further course of their life=20
will not find themselves in a position to make practical use of=20
what they had once learned. They have in their youth, there=C2=AC=20
fore, devoted thousands of hours to a subject which later is=20
without value and meaning for them. And the objection that=20
this material belongs to general education, is unsound, since it=20
could only be upheld if people retained all through their life what=20
they had learned. So in reality, because of the two thousand peo=C2=AC=20

eight thousand must be tormented for nothing and made to=20
sacrifice valuable time.=20

And in this case we are dealing with a language of which it can=C2=AC=20
not even be said that it implies a training in sharp, logical think=C2=AC=
=20
ing as applies, for example, to Latin. Hence it would be con=C2=AC=20
siderably more expedient if such a language were transmitted to=20
the young student only in its general outlines or, better expressed,=20
in its inner structure, thus giving him knowledge of the most=20
salient essence of this language, introducing him perhaps to the=20
fundamentals of its grammar and pronunciation, discussing=20
syntax, etc., by model examples. This would suffice for general=20
use and, because it is easier to visualize and remember, would be=20
more valuable than the present-day manner of drumming in the=20
whole language, which is not really mastered anyway and is later=20
forgotten. In this way, moreover, the danger would be avoided=20
that of all the overpowering abundance of material only a few=20
unconnected crumbs would stick in the memory, a,s the young=20
man would have to learn the most noteworthy aspects, and con=C2=AC=20
sequently the process of sifting according to value or the lack of it=20
would have taken place in advance.=20

The general foundation thus imparted would suffice most=20
people, even for later life, while it creates for those others who=20
really need the language later the possibility of building further=20
on it, and devoting themselves of their own free choice to learning=20
it with the greatest thoroughness.=20

Thus the necessary time in the curriculum is gained for physical=20
training as well as the increased demands in the abovementioned=20
fields.=20

Particularly in the present method of teaching history a change=20
must be made. Probably no people studies more history than the=20
German; but probably there is no people that applies it worse=20
than ours. If politics is history in the making, our historical=20
education is directed by the nature of our political activity.=20
Here, again, it is not permissible to complain about the wretched=20
results of our political achievements unless we are determined to=20
provide a better political education. The result of our present=20


General and Specialized Education=20


421=20


history instruction is wretched in ninety-nine cases out of a hun=C2=AC=20
dred. A few facts, dates, birthdays and names remain behind=20
while a broad, clear line is totally lacking. The essentials which=20
should really matter are not taught at all; it is left to the more or=20
less gifted nature of the individual to find out the inner motives=20
from the flood of dates and the sequence of events. We may argue=20
as much as we like against this bitter statement; just read at=C2=AC=20
tentively the speeches on political problems, say questions of=20
foreign policy, delivered during a single session by our parlia=C2=AC=20
mentary gentlemen; and bear in mind that these men =E2=80=94 al=C2=AC=20
legedly at least =E2=80=94 are the cream of the German nation, and that=20
at any rate a large part of them have even been at universities,=20
and from this you will be able to see how totally inadequate the=20
historical education of these people is. If they had not studied=20
history at all, but only possessed a healthy instinct, it would be=20
considerably better and more profitable for the nation.=20

Especially in historical instruction an abridgment of the=20
material must be undertaken. The main value lies in recognizing=20
the great lines of development. The more the instruction is=20
limited to this, the more it is to be hoped that an advantage will=20
later accrue to the individual from his knowledge, which summed=20
up will also benefit the community. For we do not learn history=20
just in order to know the past, we learn history in order to find=20
an instructor for the future and for the continued existence of our=20
own nationality. That is the end , and historical instruction is only=20
a means to it. But. today the means has become the end, and the=20
end disappears completely. Let it not be said that thorough=20
study of history requires attention to all these individual details,=20
on the ground that only from them can a great line be developed.=20
To lay down this line is the function of the special science. The=20
normal, average man is no history professor. For him history=20
exists primarily to give him that measure of historical insight=20
which is necessary for him to take a position of his own on the=20
political issues of his nation. Anyone who wants to become a=20
history professor may later devote himself intensively to this=20
study. It goes without saying that he will have to concern him-=20


422=20


Mein Kampf=20


self with all and even the smallest details. For this, however,=20
even our present history instruction cannot suffice; for it is too=20
extensive for the normal, average man, but much too limited for=20
the specialized scholar.=20

Aside from this, it is the task of the folkish state to see to it=20
that a world history is finally written in which the racial question=20
is raised to a dominant position.=20

# *U*=20

vv* W=20

To sum up: the folkish state will have to put general, scientific=20
instruction into an abbreviated form, embracing the essentials.=20
In addition to this, the possibility of a thorough, specialized train=C2=AC=
=20
ing must be offered. It suffices for the individual man to obtain a=20
general knowledge in broad outlines as a foundation, and only in=20
the field which will be that of his later life, to enjoy the most=20
thorough specialized and detailed training. General education=20
should be obligatory in all departments; the special training=20
should remain free to the choice of the individual.=20

The shortening of the curriculum and the number of hours=20

s=20

thus achieved will benefit the training of the body, of the char=C2=AC=20
acter, of the will power and determination.=20

How irrevelant our present-day school training, especially in=20
the high schools, is for a future profession is best demonstrated=20
by the fact that today people from three schools of an entirely=20
different nature can arrive at one and the same position. In re=C2=AC=20
ality only the general education is of decisive importance and not=20
the specialized knowledge that is funneled into them. And where=20
=E2=80=94 as I have said before =E2=80=94 a specialized knowledge is really=
 nec=C2=AC=20
essary it can naturally not be obtained within the curriculums of=20
our present high schools.=20

With such halfway methods, therefore, the folkish state must=20
some day do away.=20


* # #=20

The second change of scientific curriculum in the folkish state=20
must be the following:=20


Value of Humanistic Education=20


423=20


It is the characteristic of our present materialized epoch that=20
our scientific education is turning more and more toward practical=20
subjects =E2=80=94 in other words, mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc.=20
Necessary as this is for a period in which technology and chem=C2=AC=20
istry rule =E2=80=94 embodying at least those of its characteristics which=
=20
are most visible in daily life =E2=80=94 it is equally dangerous when the=
=20
general education of a nation is more and more exclusively di=C2=AC=20
rected toward them. This education on the contrary must always=20
be ideal. It must be more in keeping with the humanistic sub=C2=AC=20
jects and offer only the foundations for a subsequent additional=20
education in a special field. Otherwise we renounce the forces=20
which are still more important for the preservation of the nation=20
than all technical or other ability. Especially in historical in=C2=AC=20
struction we must not be deterred from the study of antiquity.=20
Roman history correctly conceived in extremely broad outlines=20
is and remains the best mentor, not only for today, but probably=20
for all time. The Hellenic ideal of culture should also remain=20
preserved for us in its exemplary beauty. We must not allow the=20
greater racial community to be torn asunder by the differences of=20
the individual peoples. The struggle that rages today is for very=20
great aims. A culture combining millenniums and embracing=20
Hellenism and Germanism is fighting for its existence.=20

A sharp difference should exist between general education and=20
specialized knowledge. As particularly today the latter threatens=20
more and more to sink into the service of pure Mammon, general=20
education, at least in its more ideal attitude, must be retained as=20
a counterweight. Here, too, we must incessantly inculcate the=20
principle that industry , technology, and commerce can thrive only as=20
long as an idealistic national community offers the necessary pre=C2=AC=20
conditions. And these do not lie in material egoism , hut in a spirit=20
of sacrifice and joyful renunciation.=20

W *VY* *7P=20

By and large the present education of youth has set itself the=20
primary goal of pumping into the young person that knowledge=20


424=20


Mein Kampf=20


which in his later career he needs for his own advancement. This=20
is expressed in the words: =E2=80=98 The young man must some day become=20
a useful member of society.=E2=80=99 By this is meant his ability some day=
=20
to earn his daily bread in a decent way. The superficial civic=20
training carried on alongside rests on a weak base to begin with.=20
Since the state in itself represents only a form, it is very hard to=20
educate, let alone obligate people with regard to it. A form can=20
too easily be shattered. But the concept =E2=80=98state=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 =
as we have=20
seen =E2=80=94 does not possess a clear content today. And so there=20
remains nothing but the current c patriotic=E2=80=99 education. In old=20
Germany its chief emphasis lay in a deification, often unintelli=C2=AC=20
gent and usually very insipid, of the small and smallest poten=C2=AC=20
tates, whose very quantity from the outset made it necessary to=20
renounce any comprehensive appreciation of our nation=E2=80=99s really=20
great men. The result among our broad masses, consequently,=20
was a very inadequate knowledge of German history. Here,=20
too, the great line was lacking.=20

That a real national enthusiasm could not be achieved in this=20
fashion is obvious. Our educational system lacked the art of=20
picking a few names out of the historical development of our=20
people and making them the common property of the whole=20
German people, thus through like knowledge and like enthusiasm=20

i=20

tying a uniform, uniting bond around the entire nation. They did=20
not understand how to make the really significant men of our=20
people appear as outstanding heroes in the eyes of the present, to=20
concentrate the general attention upon them and thus create a=20
unified mood. They were not able to raise what was glorious for=20
the nation in the various subjects of instruction above the level of=20
objective presentation, and fire the national pride by such gleam=C2=AC=20
ing examples. This would have seemed reprehensible chauvinism=20
to that period, and in this form would not have met with much=20
approval. Comfortable dynastic patriotism seemed more agree=C2=AC=20
able and easier to bear than the clamoring passion of higher na=C2=AC=20
tional pride. The former was always ready to serve, the latter=20
might some day become a master. Monarchistic patriotism=20
ended in veterans=E2=80=99 clubs, the national passion would have been=20


Prevailing =E2=80=98Patriotic=E2=80=99 Education=20


425=20


hard to direct in its course. It is like a thoroughbred horse which=20
does not carry everyone in the saddle. Is it any wonder that the=20
powers of the time preferred to keep aloof from such a danger?=20
No one seemed to consider it possible that some day there might=20
come a war that would thoroughly test the inner steadfastness=20
of our patriotic convictions in drumfire and clouds of gas. But=20
when it came, the absence of the highest national passion brought=20
the most frightful consequences. People had but little desire to=20
die for their imperial and royal lords, and the =E2=80=98nation=E2=80=99 wa=
s un=C2=AC=20
known to most of them.=20

Since the revolution made its entry into Germany and mon=C2=AC=20
archists patriotism died out of its own accord, the purpose of=20
instruction in history is really nothing more than the mere ac=C2=AC=20
quisition of knowledge. This state cannot use national enthusi=C2=AC=20
asm; but what it would like to have it will never get. For no more=20
than there could be a dynastic patriotism endowed with the ulti=C2=AC=20
mate power of resistance in an age governed by the principle of=20
nationalities , much less can there be a republican enthusiasm.=20
For there can be no doubt that under the motto, =E2=80=98For the Re=C2=AC=
=20
public,=E2=80=99 the German people would not remain in the battlefield=20
for any four and one-half years; least of all did those remain who=20
have created this amazing structure.=20

Actually this Republic owes its unshorn existence only to its willing=C2=AC=
=20
ness , of which it gives assurance on all sides , voluntarily to assume=20
all tribute payments and sign every renunciation of territory. It is=20
liked by the rest of the world; just as every weakling is considered=20
more agreeable by those who need him than a rough man. True,=20
this sympathy on the part of enemies is the most annihilating criti=C2=AC=
=20
cism for precisely this state form. Our enemies love the German=20
Republic and let it live because they could not find a better ally=20
for their enslavement of our people. To this fact alone does this=20
magnificent structure owe its present existence. That is why it=20
can renounce any truly national education and content itself with=20
cries of =E2=80=98 Hoch =E2=80=99 from Reichsbanner 1 heroes who, incidenta=
lly, if=20

1 Reichsbanner Schwarz - Rot - Gold . Semi-military republican organization=
=20
founded on February 22, 1924, by the Social Democrats Otto Horsing and=20
Holterman. In 1932, it had three and a half million members.=20


426=20


Mein Kampf=20


they had to protect this banner with their blood, would run away=20
like rabbits.=20

The folkish state will have to fight for its existence. It will=20
neither obtain it by Dawes signatures, nor be able to defend its=20
existence by them. For its existence and for its protection, it will=20
need the very things that people today think they can do without.=20
The more incomparable and precious its form and content will be,=20
the greater will be the envy and resistance of its enemies. Its best=20
defense will lie not in its weapons, but in its citizens; no fortress=20
walls will protect it, but a living wall of men and women filled=20
with supreme love of their fatherland and fanatical national=20
enthusiasm.=20

The third point to be considered in scientific education is the=20
following:=20

Science, too, must be regarded by the folkish state as an instrument=20
for the advancement of national pride. Not only world history but=20
all cultural history must be taught from this standpoint. An in=C2=AC=20
ventor must not only seem great as an inventor , but must seem even=20
greater as a national comrade. Our admiration of every great deed=20
must be bathed in pride that its fortunate performer is a member of=20
our own people. From all the innumerable great names of German=20
history, the greatest must be picked out and introduced to the youth so=20
persistently that they become pillars of an unshakable national=20
sentiment.=20

The curriculum must be systematically built up along these=20
lines so that when the young man leaves his school he is not a half=20
pacifist, democrat, or something else, but a whole German.=20

In order that this national sentiment should be genuine from=20
the outset and not consist in mere hollow pretense, beginning in=20
youth one iron principle must be hammered into those heads=20
which are still capable of education: any man who loves his people=20
proves it solely by the sacrifices which he is prepared to make for it.=20
There is no such thing as national sentiment which is only out for=20
gain. No more is there any nationalism which only embraces classes.=20
Shouting hurrah proves nothing and gives no right to call oneself=20
national if behind it there does not stand a great, loving concern for=20


Awakening of National Pride=20


427=20


the preservation of a universal healthy nation. There is ground for=20
pride in o ^r people only if we no longer need he ashamed of any class.=20
But a people, half of which is wretched and careworn, or even de=C2=AC=20
praved, offers so sorry a picture that no one should feel any pride in=20
it. Only when a nation is healthy in all its members, in body and=20
soul, can every man's joy in belonging to it rightfully be magnified to=20
that high sentiment which we designate as national pride. And this=20
highest pride will only be felt by the man who knows the greatness of=20
his nation.=20

An intimate coupling of nationalism and a sense of social justice=20
must be implanted in the young heart. Then a people of citizens will=20
some day arise, bound to one another and forged together by a common=20
love and a common pride, unshakable and invincible forever.=20

Our era's fear of chauvinism is the sign of its impotence. Not only=20
lacking any exuberant force, but even finding it distasteful, it is no=20
longer destined by Fate for a great deed. For the greatest revolutionary=20
changes on this earth would not have been thinkable if their motive=20
force, instead of fanatical, yes, hysterical passion, had been merely=20
the bourgeois virtues of law and order.=20

And assuredly this world is moving toward a great revolution. The=20
question can only be whether it will redound to the benefit of Aryan=20
humanity or to the profit of the eternal Jew.=20

The folkish state will have to make certain that by a suitable educa=C2=AC=
=20
tion of youth it will some day obtain a race ripe for the last and=20
greatest decisions on this earth.=20

And the people which first sets out on this path will be victorious.=20


# * #=20


The crown of the folkish state's entire work of education and=20
training must be to burn the racial sense and racial feeling into the=20
instinct and the intellect, the heart and brain of the youth entrusted to=
=20
it. No boy and no girl must leave school without having been led to=20
an ultimate realization of the necessity and essence of blood purity.=20
Thus the groundwork is created by preserving the racial founda-=20


428=20


Mein Kampf=20


tions of our nation and through them in turn securing the basis=20
for its future cultural development.=20

For all physical and all intellectual training would in the last=20
analysis remain worthless if it did not benefit a being which is=20
ready and determined on principle to preserve himself and his=20
special nature.=20

Otherwise that would occur which we Germans even now must=20
greatly deplore, though perhaps the full extent of this tragic mis=C2=AC=20
fortune has hitherto not been realized: that in the future we remain=20
nothing but cultural fertilizer, not only in the limited conception of=20
our present bourgeois view, which regards an individual national=20
comrade lost as nothing more than a lost citizen, but with the painful=20
realization that in this event, despite all our knowledge and ability,=20
our blood is nevertheless doomed to decline. By mating again and=20
again with other races, we may raise these races from their previous=20
cultural level to a higher stage, but we will descend forever from our=20
own high level.=20

For the rest this education, too, from the racial viewpoint, must=20
find its ultimate completion in military service. And in general, the=20
period of military service must be regarded as the conclusion of the=20
average German=E2=80=99s normal education .=20


# # #=20

Important as the type of physical and mental education will be=20
in the folkish state, equally important will be the human selection as=20
such. Today this matter is taken lightly. In general it is the=20
children of high-placed, at the time well-situated parents who are=20
considered worthy of a higher education. Questions of talent=20
play a subordinate role. Taken in itself, talent can only be evalu=C2=AC=20
ated relatively. A peasant boy can possess far more talents than=20
the child of parents enjoying an elevated position in life for many=20
generations, even if he is inferior to the bourgeois child in general=20
knowledge. The latter=E2=80=99s greater knowledge has in itself nothing=20
to do with greater or lesser talent, but is rooted in the materially=20


State Selection oe the Fit=20


429=20


greater abundance of impressions which the child continuously=20
receives as a result of his more varied education and rich environ=C2=AC=20
ment. If the talented peasant boy from his early years had like=C2=AC=20
wise grown up in such an environment, his intellectual ability=20
would be quite different. Today, perhaps, there is a single field=20
in which origin is really less decisive than the individual=E2=80=99s nativ=
e=20
talent: the field of art. Here where a man cannot merely Team/=20
but everything has to be originally innate and is only later sub=C2=AC=20
ject to a more or less favorable development in the sense of wise=20
encouragement of existing gifts, the money and wealth of the=20
parents are almost irrelevant. Hence it is here best shown that=20
talent is not bound up with the higher walks of life, let alone with=20
wealth. The greatest artists arise not seldom from the poorest=20
houses. And many a poor village boy has later become a cele=C2=AC=20
brated master.=20

It does not exactly argue great depth of thought in our time=20
that this realization is not applied to our whole spiritual life.=20
People imagine that what cannot be denied in art does not apply=20
to the so-called exact sciences. Without doubt certain mechanical=20
abilities can be taught a man, just as clever training can teach a=20
docile poodle the most amazing tricks. But in animal training,=20
the intelligence of the animal does not of itself lead to such ex=C2=AC=20
ercises, and the same is the case with man. Without regard for=20
any other talent, man too can be taught certain scientific tricks,=20
but the process is just as lifeless and inwardly uninspired as with=20
the animal. On the basis of a certain intellectual drill, knowledge=20
above the average can be crammed into an average man; but it=20
remains dead, and in the last analysis sterile knowledge. The=20
result is a man who may be a living dictionary but nevertheless=20
falls down miserably in all special situations and decisive mo=C2=AC=20
ments in life; he will always have to be coached again for every=20
situation, even the simplest, and by his own resources will not be=20
able to make the slightest contribution to the development of=20
humanity. Such a mechanically drilled knowledge suffices at=20
most for assuming state positions in our present period.=20

It goes without saving that in the totality of a nation=E2=80=99s popula-=
=20


430=20


Mein Kampf=20


tion talents will be found for every possible domain of daily life.=20
It is furthermore obvious that the value of knowledge will be the=20
greater, the more the dead knowledge is animated by the relevant=20
talent in the individual. Creative achievements can only arise when=20
ability and knowledge are wedded.=20

The boundless sins of present-day humanity in this direction=20
may be shown by one more example. From time to time il=C2=AC=20
lustrated papers bring it to the attention of the German petty-=20
bourgeois that some place or other a Negro has for the first time=20
become a lawyer, teacher, even a pastor, in fact a heroic tenor, or=20
something of the sort. While the idiotic bourgeoisie looks with=20
amazement at such miracles of education, full of respect for this=20
marvelous result of modern educational skill, the Jew shrewdly=20
draws from it a new proof for the soundness of his theory about=20
the equality of men that he is trying to funnel into the minds of=20
the nations. It doesn=E2=80=99t dawn on this depraved bourgeois world=20
that this is positively a sin against all reason; that it is criminal=20
lunacy to keep on drilling a born half-ape until people think they=20
have made a lawyer out of him, while millions of members of the=20
highest culture-race must remain in entirely unworthy positions;=20
that it is a sin against the will of the Eternal Creator if His most=20
gifted beings by the hundreds and hundreds of thousands are=20
allowed to degenerate in the present proletarian morass, while=20
Hottentots and Zulu Kaffirs are trained for intellectual profes=C2=AC=20
sions. For this is training exactly like that of the poodle, and not=20
scientific =E2=80=98education.=E2=80=99 The same pains and care employed on=
 in=C2=AC=20
telligent races would a thousand times sooner make every single=20
individual capable of the same achievements.=20

But intolerable as this state of affairs would be if it ever con=C2=AC=20
sisted of anything but exceptions, equally intolerable is it today in=20
places where it is not talent and inborn gifts that decide who is=20
chosen for higher education. Yes, indeed, it is an intolerable=20
thought that every year hundreds of thousands of completely=20
ungifted people are held worthy of a higher education, while=20
other hundreds of thousands with great talent remain deprived=20
of higher education. The loss which the nation thereby suffers is=20


State Selection of the Fit=20


431=20


inestimable. If in the last decades the wealth of important in=C2=AC=20
ventions has increased amazingly, especially in North America, it=20
is not least because there materially more talents from the lowest=20
classes find opportunity for higher education than is the case in=20
Europe.=20

For invention, drilled knowledge does not suffice, but only=20
knowledge animated by talent. But in our country today no=20
store is set on this; it is only good marks that matter.=20

Here, too, the folkish state will some day have to intervene by=20
education. Its task is not to preserve the decisive influence of an=20
existing social class, but to pick the most capable kinds from the sum=20
of all the national comrades and bring them to office and dignity . It=20
has not only the obligation of giving the average child a certain=20
education in public school, but also the duty of putting talent on=20
the track where it belongs. Above all, it must see its highest task=20
in opening the gates of the higher state educational institutions=20
to all talent, absolutely regardless from what circles it may origi=C2=AC=
=20
nate. It must fulfill this task, since only in this way can repre=C2=AC=20
sentatives of a dead knowledge be transformed into brilliant=20
leaders of a nation.=20

And for another reason the state must take measures in this=20
direction: our intellectual classes, especially in Germany, are so=20
segregated and so ossified that they lack a living connection with=20
the people below them. We suffer from this in two ways: in the=20
first place, they lack as a consequence any understanding and=20
feeling for the broad masses. They have been torn out of this=20
relation too long to possess the necessary psychological under=C2=AC=20
standing for the people. They have become alien to the people.=20
And in the second place, these intellectual strata lack the neces=C2=AC=20
sary will-power, which is always weaker in this secluded intel=C2=AC=20
lectual caste than in the mass of the primitive people. We Ger=C2=AC=20
mans, by God, have never lacked scientific education; but we=20
have been all the more lacking in any will power and determina=C2=AC=20
tion. The more =E2=80=98intellectual* our statesmen were, for example,=20
the feebler, as a rule, was their actual accomplishment. The=20
political preparations, as well as the technical armament for the=20


432=20


Mein Kampf=20


World War, was not inadequate because insufficiently educated=20
minds ruled our people, but because the rulers were overeducated=20
men, crammed full of knowledge and intellect, but bereft of any=20
healthy instinct and devoid of all energy and boldness. It was a=20
calamity that our people had to conduct its struggle for existence=20
under the Chancellorship of a philosophizing weakling. If, instead=20
of a Bethmann-Hollweg, we had had a robuster man of the people=20
as a leader, the heroic blood of the common grenadier would not=20
have flowed in vain. Likewise, the excessively rarefied pure intel=C2=AC=20
lect of our leader material was the best ally of the revolutionist=20
November scoundrels. By disgracefully withholding the na=C2=AC=20
tional treasure that had been entrusted to them, instead of staking=20
it fully and wholly, these intellectuals themselves created the=20
premise for the enemy=E2=80=99s success.=20

In this the Catholic Church can be regarded as a'model ex=C2=AC=20
ample. The celibacy of its priests is a force compelling it to draw=20
the future generation again and again from the masses of the=20
broad people instead of from their own ranks. But it is this very=20
significance of celibacy that is not at all recognized by most=20
people. It is the cause of the incredibly vigorous strength which=20
resides in this age-old institution. For through the fact that this=20
gigantic army of spiritual dignitaries is continuously comple=C2=AC=20
mented from the lowest strata of the nations, the Church not only=20
obtains its instinctive bond with the emotional world of the peo=C2=AC=20
ple, but also assures itself a sum of energy and active force which=20
in such a form will forever exist only in the broad masses of the=20
people. From this arises the amazing youthfulness of this gi=C2=AC=20
gantic organism, its spiritual suppleness and iron will-power.=20

It will be the task of a folkish state to make certain through its=20
educational system that a continuous renezval of the existing intel=C2=AC=
=20
lectual classes through an influx of fresh blood from below takes=20
place . The state has the obligation to exercise extreme care and=20
precision in picking from the total number of national comrades=20
the human material visibly most gifted by Nature and to use it=20
in the service of the community. For state and statesmen do not=20
exist in order to provide individual classes with a living but to=20


Evaluation of Work=20


433=20


fulfill the tasks allotted to them. This will only be possible if as=20
a matter ^=C2=BBf principle only capable and strong-willed personalities=20
are trained to deal with these tasks. This applies not only to all=20
official positions but to the intellectual leadership of the nation=20
in all fields. Another factor for the greatness of the people is that=20
it succeed in training the most capable minds for the field suited=20
to them and placing them in the service of the national com=C2=AC=20
munity. If two peoples, equally well endowed, compete with one=20
another, that one will achieve victory which has represented in its=20
total intellectual leadership its best talents and that one will succumb=20
whose leadership represents only a big common feeding crib for=20
certain groups or classes, without regard to the innate abilities of the=20
various members.=20

To be sure, this looks impossible at first sight in our present=20
world. The objection will at once be raised that the little son of=20
a higher government official, for example, cannot be expected,=20
let us say, to become an artisan because someone else whose=20
parents were artisans seems more capable. This may be true in=20
view of the present estimation of manual labor. For this reason=20
the folkish state will have to arrive at a basically different attitude=20
toward the concept of labor. It will , if necessary, even by education=20
extending over centuries, have to break with the mischief of despising=20
physical activity. On principle it will have to evaluate the individual=20
man not according to the type of work he does but according to the=20
form and quality of his achievement. This may appear positively=20
monstrous to an era in which the most brainless columnist, just=20
because he works with the pen, seems superior to the most intel=C2=AC=20
ligent precision mechanic. This false estimation, as has been said,=20
does not lie in the nature of things, but is artificially cultivated=20
and formerly did not exist. The present unnatural condition is=20
based on the generally diseased condition of our present material=C2=AC=20
ized epoch.=20

Fundamentally, the value of all work is twofold: a purely ma=C2=AC=20
terial value and an ideal value. The material value resides in the=20
importance, that is to say, the material importance of a piece of=20
work for the life of the totality. The more national comrades=20


434=20


Mein Kampf=20


draw profit from a certain achievement performed, including=20
direct and indirect profit, the greater the material value is to be=20
estimated. This estimation, in turn, finds its plastic expression=20
in the material reward which the individual obtains from his=20
work. Contrasting with this purely material value, we now have=20
the ideal value. It does not rest in the importance of the work=20
performed measured materially, but in its necessity in itself.=20
As surely as the material profit of an invention can be greater=20
than that of an everyday handy-man=E2=80=99s service, just as surely does=
=20
the totality need the small service just as much as the great one.=20
It may make a material distinction in evaluating the benefit of the=20
individual piece of work for the totality, and can express this by a=20
corresponding reward; in an ideal sense, however, it must recog=C2=AC=20
nize the equality of all as long as every individual endeavors to=20
do his best in his field =E2=80=94 whatever it may be. It is on this that=
=20
the estimation of a man must be based, and not on his reward.=20

Since the concern of a sensible state must be to allot to the in=C2=AC=20
dividual the activity which is in keeping with his ability or, other=C2=AC=
=20
wise expressed, to train the capable minds for the work that is=20
suited to them, but since ability and principle are not taught but=20
must be inborn, hence are a gift of Nature and not an achieve=C2=AC=20
ment of man, general civic estimation cannot depend on the=20
work that has, so to speak, been allotted to the individual. For=20
this work falls to the account of his birth vind to the training=20
which he has consequently received through the community.=20
The evaluation of the man must be based on the manner in which=20
he fulfills the task entrusted him by the community. For the=20
activity which the individual performs is not the end of his exist=C2=AC=20
ence, but only the means to it. It is more important for him to=20
develop and ennoble himself as a man, but he can do this only=20
within the framework of his cultural community which must al=C2=AC=20
ways rest on the fundament of a state. He must make his con=C2=AC=20
tribution to the preservation of this fundament. The form of this=20
contribution is determined by Nature; his duty is only to return=20
to the national community with honest industry what it has=20
given him. Anyone who does this deserves the highest estimation=20


Evaluation of Work=20


435=20


and the highest respect. Material reward may be granted to him=20
whose achievement brings corresponding benefit to the community;=20
his ideal reward, however, must lie in the esteem which everyone can=20
claim who dedicates to the service of his nationality the forces which=20
Nature gave him and which the national community has trained.=20
Then it is no longer a disgrace to be an honest manual worker,=20
but it is a disgrace to be an incompetent official, stealing the day=C2=AC=
=20
light from his maker and daily bread from honest people. Then=20
it will be taken for granted that a man will not be allotted tasks=20
to which he is not equal to begin with.=20

Moreover, such activity provides the sole standard for right=20
in universal, equal, juridical civic activity . 1=20

The present era is liquidating itself: it introduces universal=20
suffrage, shoots off its mouth about equal rights, but finds no=20
basis for them. It sees in material reward the expression of a=20
man=E2=80=99s worth and thereby shatters the foundation for the noblest=20
equality that there can be. For equality does not rest and never=20
can rest on the achievements of individuals in themselves, but it=20
is possible in the form in which everyone fulfills his special obliga=C2=AC=
=20
tions. Thereby alone is the accident of Nature excluded in the=20
judgment of the man=E2=80=99s worth, and the individual himself becomes=20
the smith of his own importance.=20

In the present period, when entire human groups can estimate=20
one another only according to salary classes, there is =E2=80=94 as said=20
before =E2=80=94 no understanding for this. But for us this cannot be a=20
reason to renounce the fight for our ideas. On the contrary:=20
anyone who wants to cure this era, which is inwardly sick and rotten ,=20
must first of all summon up the courage to make clear the causes of=20
this disease. And this should be the concern of the National Socialist=20
movement: pushing aside all philistinism, to gather and to organize=20
from the ranks of our nation those forces capable of becoming the van=C2=AC=
=20
guard fighters for a new philosophy of life.=20

Mein Kampf=20


Of course, the objection will be made that in general the ideal=20
estimation is hard to separate from the material, indeed, that the=20
diminishing estimation of physical labor is brought about pre=C2=AC=20
cisely by its diminished reward. And that this diminished reward=20
is in turn the cause for the limitation of the individual man=E2=80=99s=20
participation in the cultural treasures of his nation. And that=20
precisely the ideal culture of man, which does not necessarily=20
have anything to do with his activity as such, is impaired thereby.=20
That the dread of physical labor is really based on the fact that,=20
as a result of the inferior reward, the cultural level of the manual=20
worker is necessarily lowered and that this provides the justifica=C2=AC=20
tion for a general diminished estimation.=20

In this there lies much truth. For this very reason we must in=20
future guard ourselves against an excessive differentiation of=20
wage rates. Let it not be said that this would destroy achieve=C2=AC=20
ment. It would be the saddest sign of the decay of a period if the=20
impetus to a higher spiritual achievement lay only in the in=C2=AC=20
creased wage. If this criterion had been the sole determinant in=20
the world up to now, humanity would never have received its=20
greatest scientific and cultural treasures. For the greatest in=C2=AC=20
ventions, the greatest discoveries, the most revolutionary scien=C2=AC=20
tific work, the most magnificent monuments of human culture,=20
have not been given to the world through the urge for money.=20
On the contrary, their birth not seldom meant positive renuncia=C2=AC=20
tion of the earthly happiness of riches.=20

It may be that today gold has become the exclusive ruler of=20
life, but the time will come when man will again bow down before=20
a higher god. Many things today may owe their existence solely=20
to the longing for money and wealth, but there is very little=20
among them whose non-existence would leave humanity any. the=20
poorer.=20

This, too, is a task of our movement; even now it must herald=20
a day which will give to the individual what he needs for living,=20
but uphold the principle that man does not live exclusively for=20
the sake of material pleasures. This must some day find its ex=C2=AC=20
pression in a wisely limited gradation of earnings which in any=20


Ideal and Reality=20


437=20


event will give every decent working man an honest, regular=20
existence as a national comrade and a man.=20

Let it not be said that this is an ideal condition which this=20
world will not tolerate in practice and will actually never achieve.=20

We are not simple enough , either , to believe that it could ever be=20
possible to bring about a perfect era. But this relieves no one of the=20
obligation to combat recognized errors , to overcome weaknesses , and=20
strive for the ideal. Harsh reality of its own accord will create only=20
too many limitations. For that very reason , however , man must try=20
to serve the ultimate goal , and failures must not deter him , any more=20
than he can abandon a system of justice merely because mistakes=20
creep into it , or any more than a medicament is discarded because=20
there will always be sickness in spite of it.=20

Care must be taken not to underestimate the force of an idea.=20
I should like to remind those who become faint-hearted in this=20
connection =E2=80=94 in case they were ever soldiers =E2=80=94 of a time wh=
ose=20
heroism represented the most overpowering proof of the force of=20
idealistic motives. For what made men die then was not concern=20
for their daily bread, but love of the fatherland, faith in its great=C2=AC=
=20
ness, a general feeling for the honor of the nation. It was when=20
the German people moved away from these ideals to follow the=20
material premises of the revolution, and exchanged their arms for=20
knapsacks , 1 that they arrived, not at the earthly paradise, but at=20
the purgatory of general contempt and, no less, of general misery.=20

Therefore it is really necessary to confront the master book=C2=AC=20
keepers of the present material republic by faith in an ideal Reich.=20

1 In German there are two words for knapsack. A military knap=C2=AC=20
sack is a Tornister ; the word here used is Rucksack. This is the type=20
worn by hikers. But Hitler is referring to the hungry proletarians after=20
the War who went out foraging with knapsacks.=20


CHAPTER=20

III=20


Subjects and Citizens=20


In general the formation which today is=20
erroneously designated as a state knows only two varieties of=20
people: citizens and foreigners. Citizens are all those who either=20
by their birth or subsequent naturalization possess the right of=20
citizenship. Foreigners are all those who enjoy this same right in=20
another state. In between, there are comet-like phenomena: the=20
so-called stateless. These are people who have the honor of belong=C2=AC=20
ing to no present-day state; in other words, who nowhere possess=20
the right of citizenship.=20

Today the right of citizenship, as mentioned above, is primarily=20
achieved by birth within the borders of a state. In this, race or=20
nationality play no role whatever. A Negro, who formerly lived=20
in the German protectorates and now has his residence in Ger=C2=AC=20
many, gives birth to a =E2=80=98 German citizen =E2=80=99 in the person of =
his child.=20
Likewise every Jewish or Polish, African or Asiatic child can be=20
declared a German citizen without further ado.=20

Aside from becoming a citizen through birth, there is the pos=C2=AC=20
sibility of naturalization later. It is connected with certain re=C2=AC=20
quirements; for example, that the candidate in question is if pos=C2=AC=20
sible no burglar or pimp; that he furthermore be politically un=C2=AC=20
objectionable, in other words, a harmless political idiot; that=20
finally he should not fall a burden to the country which grants=20
him citizenship. In this materialistic age this means, of course, a=20
financial burden. Yes, it is even considered a desirable recom-=20



How to Become a Citizen=20


439=20


mendation if you are presumably a good future taxpayer to hasten=20
the acquisition of present-day citizenship.=20

Racial objections play no role whatsoever in this.=20

The whole process of acquiring citizenship takes place not far=20
differently than admission into an automobile club. The man=20
makes his application, it is examined and passed upon, and one=20
day he receives a note informing him that he has become a citi=C2=AC=20
zen, and even the form of this is cute and kittenish. The former=20
Zulu Kaffir in question is informed: =E2=80=98You have hereby become a=20
German !=E2=80=99=20

This magic trick is performed by a state president. What the=20
heavens could not accomplish, such an official Theophrastus=20
Paracelsus has accomplished in the twinkling of an eye. A simple=20
dab of the pen and a Mongolian Wenceslaus has suddenly become=20
a regular =E2=80=98German.=E2=80=99=20

But not only do they not concern themselves about the race of=20
such a new citizen; they do not even pay any attention to his=20
physical health. Such a fellow may be as eaten by syphilis as he=20
likes, for the present state he is nevertheless highly welcome as a=20
citizen, provided that he does not, as above stated, represent a=20
financial burden and a political danger.=20

And so every year these formations, called states, take into=20
themselves poison elements which they can scarcely ever over=C2=AC=20
come.=20

The citizen himself then is only distinguished from the for=C2=AC=20
eigner by the fact that the road to all public offices is open to him,=20
that he may have to do military service, and that to make up for=20
this he can actively and passively participate in elections. By=20
and large this is all. For the protection of personal rights and of=20
personal freedom is equally enjoyed by foreigners, not seldom=20
more so; in any case, this applies in our present German Republic.=20

I know that people do not like to hear all this; but anything=20
more thoughtless, more hare-brained than our present-day citizen=C2=AC=20
ship lav/s scarcely exists. There is today one state in which at=20
least weak beginnings toward a better conception are noticeable.=20
Of course, it is not our model German Republic, but the American=20


440=20


Mein Kampf=20


Union, in which an effort is made to consult reason at least par=C2=AC=20
tially. By refusing immigration on principle to elements in poor=20
health, by simply excluding certain races from naturalization, it=20
professes in slow beginnings a view which is peculiar to the=20
folkish state concept.=20

The folkish state divides its inhabitants into three classes:=20
citizens, subjects, and foreigners.=20

On principle only the status of subject is acquired by birth.=20
The status of subject as such does not confer the right to hold=20
public office, nor to carry on political activity in the sense of=20
active or passive participation in elections. As a matter of prin=C2=AC=20
ciple, the race and nationality of every subject must be deter=C2=AC=20
mined. The subject is free at any time to renounce his status of=20
subject and become a citizen in the country whose nationality=20
corresponds to his own. The foreigner is distinguished from the=20
subject only by the fact that he is a subject of a foreign state.=20

The young subject of German nationality is obligated to=20
undergo the schooling prescribed for every German. He thus=20
submits to education to make him a racially conscious and=20
patriotic national comrade. Later he must perform the supple=C2=AC=20
mentary physical exercises prescribed by the state, and finally he=20
enters the army. The training in the army is general; it must em=C2=AC=20
brace every individual German and train him in the field of mili=C2=AC=20
tary service made possible by his physical and intellectual ability.=20
Thereupon, after completion of his military duty, the right of=20
citizenship is most solemnly bestowed on the irreproachable,=20
healthy young man. It is the most precious document for his=20
whole life on earth. With it he enters upon all the rights of=20
citizen and partakes of all his advantages. For the state must=20
make a sharp distinction between those who, as national com=C2=AC=20
rades, are the cause and bearer of its existence and its greatness,=20
and those who only take up residence within a state, as =E2=80=98 earning =
=E2=80=99=20
elements.=20

The bestowal of the certificate of citizenship must be associated=20
with a solemn oath to the national community and the state. In=20
this document there must lie a common bond which bridges all=20


The Citizen Is Lord of the Reich=20


441=20


other gaps. It must be a greater honor to be a street-cleaner and citi=C2=
=AC=20
zen of this Reich than a king in a foreign state.=20

The citizen is privileged as against the foreigner. He is the lord of=20
the Reich. But this higher dignity also obligates. The man with=C2=AC=20
out honor or character, the common criminal, the traitor to the=20
fatherland, etc., can at any time be divested of this honor. He=20
thus again becomes a subject.=20

The German girl is a subject and only becomes a citizen when=20
she marries. But the right of citizenship can also be granted to=20
female German subjects active in economic life.=20

Personality and the Conception of the=20
Folkish State=20


T=20

JL he folkish National Socialist state sees its=20
chief task in educating and preserving the hearer of the state. It is=20
not sufficient to encourage the racial elements as such, to educate=20
them and finally instruct them in the needs of practical life; the=20
state must also adjust its own organization to this task.=20

It would be lunacy to try to estimate the value of man accord=C2=AC=20
ing to his race, thus declaring war on the Marxist idea that men=20
are equal, unless we are determined to draw the ultimate conse=C2=AC=20
quences. And the ultimate consequence of recognizing the im=C2=AC=20
portance of blood =E2=80=94 that is, of the racial foundation in general =
=E2=80=94=20
is the transference of this estimation to the individual person. In=20
general, I must evaluate peoples differently on the basis of the=20
race they belong to, and the same applies to the individual men=20
within a national community. The realization that peoples are=20
not equal transfers itself to the individual man within a national=20
community, in the sense that men=E2=80=99s minds cannot be equal, since=20
here, too, the blood components, though equal in their broad out=C2=AC=20
lines, are, in particular cases, subject to thousands of the finest=20
differentiations.=20

The first consequence of this realization might at the same time=20
be called the cruder one: an attempt to promote in the most=20
exemplary way those elements within the national community=20
that have been recognized as especially valuable from the racial=20
viewpoint and to provide for their special increase.=20


The Aristocratic Principle=20


443=20


This task is cruder because it can be recognized and solved al=C2=AC=20
most mechanically. It is more difficult to recognize among the=20
whole people the minds that are most valuable in the intellectual=20
and ideal sense, and to gain for them that influence which not=20
only is the due of these superior minds, but which above all is=20
beneficial to the nation. This sifting according to capacity and=20
ability cannot be undertaken mechanically; it is a task which the=20
struggle of daily life unceasingly performs.=20

A philosophy of life which endeavors to reject the democratic=20
mass idea and give this earth to the best people =E2=80=94 that is, the hig=
hest=20
humanity =E2=80=94 must logically obey the same aristocratic principle=20
within this people and make sure that the leadership and the=20
highest influence in this people fall to the best minds . Thus, it=20
builds, not upon the idea of the majority, but upon the idea of=20
personality .=20

Anyone who believes today that a folkish National Socialist=20
state must distinguish itself from other states only in a purely=20
mechanical sense, by a superior construction of its economic life=20
=E2=80=94 that is, by a better balance between rich and poor, or giving=20
broad sections of the population more right to influence the=20
economic process, or by fairer wages by elimination of excessive=20
wage differentials =E2=80=94 has not gone beyond the most superficial=20
aspect of the matter and has not the faintest idea of what we=20
call a philosophy. All the things we have just mentioned offer not=20
the slightest guaranty of continued existence, far less of any=20
claim to greatness. A people which did not go beyond these=20
really superficial reforms would not obtain the least guaranty of=20
victory in the general struggle of nations. A movement which=20
finds the content of its mission only in such a general leveling,=20
assuredly just as it may be, will truly bring about no great and=20
profound, hence real, reform of existing conditions, since its=20
entire activity does not, in the last analysis, go beyond externals,=20
and does not give the people that inner armament which enables=20
it, with almost inevitable certainty I might say, to overcome in=20
the end those weaknesses from which we suffer today.=20

To understand this more easily, it may be expedient to cast=20


444=20


Mein Kampf=20


one more glance at the real origins and causes of human cultural=20
development.=20

The first step which outwardly and visibly removed man from=20
the animal was that of invention. Invention itself is originally=20
based on the finding of stratagems and ruses, the use of which=20
facilitates the life struggle with other beings, and is sometimes=20
the actual prerequisite for its favorable course. These most=20
primitive inventions do not yet cause the personality to appear=20
with sufficient distinctness, because, of course, they enter the con=C2=AC=
=20
sciousness of the future, or rather the present, human observer,=20
only as a mass phenomenon. Certain dodges and crafty measures=20
which man, for example, can observe in the animal catch his eye=20
only as a summary fact, and he is no longer in a position to estab=C2=AC=20
lish or investigate their origin, but must simply content himself=20
with designating such phenomena as =E2=80=98 instinctive/=20

But in our case this last word means nothing at all. For anyone=20
who believes in a higher development of living creatures must=20
admit that every expression of their life urge and life struggle=20
must have had a beginning; that one subject must have started it,=20
and that subsequently such a phenomenon repeated itself more=20
and more frequently and spread more and more, until at last it=20
virtually entered the subconscious of all members of a given=20
species, thus manifesting itself as an instinct.=20

This will be understood and believed more readily in the case=20
of man. His first intelligent measures in the struggle with other=20
beasts assuredly originate in the actions of individual, particularly=20
able subjects. Here, too, the personality was once unquestionably=20
the cause of decisions and acts which later were taken over by all=20
humanity and regarded as perfectly self-evident. Just as any=20
obvious military principle, which today has become, as it were,=20
the basis of all strategy, originally owed its appearance to one=20
absolutely distinct mind, and only in the course of many, perhaps=20
even thousands of years, achieved universal validity and was=20
taken entirely for granted.=20

Man complements this first invention by a second: he learns to=20
place other objects and also living creatures in the service of ffis=20


Personality and Cultural Progress=20


445=20


own struggle for self-preservation; and thus begins man=E2=80=99s real in-=
=20
ventive activity which today is generally visible. These material=20
inventions, starting with the use of stone as a weapon and leading=20
to the domestication of beasts, giving man artificial fire, and so on=20
up to the manifold and amazing inventions of our day, show the=20
individual creator the more clearly, the closer the various inven=C2=AC=20
tions lie to the present day, or the more significant and incisive=20
they are. At all events, we know that all the material inventions=20
we see about us are the result of the creative power and ability of=20
the individual personality. And all these inventions in the last=20
analysis help to raise man more and more above the level of the=20
animal world and finally to remove him from it. Thus, funda=C2=AC=20
mentally, they serve the continuous process of higher human=20
development. But the very same thing which once, in the form=20
of the simplest ruse, facilitated the struggle for existence of the=20
man hunting in the primeval forest, again contributes, in the=20
shape of the most brilliant scientific knowledge of the present era,=20
to alleviate mankind=E2=80=99s struggle for existence and to forge its=20
weapons for the struggles of the future. All human thought and=20
invention, in their ultimate effects, primarily serve man=E2=80=99s struggl=
e=20
for existence on this planet, even when the so-called practical use=20
of an invention or a discovery or a profound scientific insight into=20
the essence of things is not visible at the moment. All these things=20
together, by contributing to raise man above the living creatures=20
surrounding him, strengthen him and secure his position, so that=20
in every respect he develops into the dominant being on this earth.=20

Thus, all inventions are the result of an individual=E2=80=99s work.=20
All these individuals, whether intentionally or unintentionally,=20
are more or less great benefactors of all men. Their work subse=C2=AC=20
quently gives millions, nay, billions of human creatures, instru=C2=AC=20
ments with which to facilitate and carry out their life struggle.=20

If in the origin of our present material culture we always find=20
individuals in the form of inventors, complementing one another=20
and one building upon another, we find the same in the practice=20
and execution of the things devised and discovered by the inven=C2=AC=20
tors. For all productive processes in turn must in their origin be=20


446=20


Mein Kampf=20


considered equivalent to inventions, hence dependent on the=20
individual. Even purely theoretical intellectual work, which in=20
particular cases is not measurable, yet is the premise for all=20
further material inventions, appears as the exclusive product of=20
the individual person. It is not the mass that invents and not the=20
majority .that organizes or thinks, but in all things only and al=C2=AC=20
ways the individual man, the person.=20

A human community appears well organized only if it facili=C2=AC=20
tates the labors of these creative forces in the most helpful way=20
and applies them in a manner beneficial to all. The most valuable=20
thing about the invention itself, whether it lie in the material=20
field or in the world of ideas, is primarily the inventor as a per=C2=AC=20
sonality. Therefore, to employ him in a way benefiting the=20
totality is the first and highest task in the organization of a=20
national community. Indeed, the organization itself must be a=20
realization of this principle. Thus, also, it is redeemed from the=20
curse of mechanism and becomes a living thing. It must itself be an=20
embodiment of the endeavor to place thinking individuals above the=20
masses , thus subordinating the latter to the former.=20

Consequently, the organization must not only not prevent the=20
emergence of thinking individuals from the mass; on the contrary,=20
it must in the highest degree make this possible and easy by the=20
nature of its own being. In this it must proceed from the principle=20
that the salvation of mankind has never lain in the masses, but=20
in its creative minds, which must therefore really be regarded as=20
benefactors of the human race. To assure them of the most deci=C2=AC=20
sive influence and facilitate their work is in the interest of the=20
totality. Assuredly this interest is not satisfied, and is not=20
served by the domination of the unintelligent or incompetent, in=20
any case uninspired masses, but solely by the leadership of those=20
to whom Nature has given special gifts for this purpose.=20

The selection of these minds, as said before, is primarily ac=C2=AC=20
complished by the hard struggle for existence. Many break and=20
perish, thus showing that they are not destined for the ultimate,=20
and in the end only a few appear to be chosen. In the fields of=20
thought, artistic creation, even, in fact, of economic life, this=20


Marxism Negates the Value of Personality 447=20


selective process is still going on today, though, especially in the=20
latter field, it faces a grave obstacle. The administration of the=20
state and likewise the power embodied in the organized military=20
might of the nation are also dominated by these ideas. Here, too,=20
the idea of personality is everywhere dominant =E2=80=94 its authority=20
downward and its responsibility toward the higher personality=20
above. Only political life has today completely turned away=20
from this most natural principle. While all human culture is=20
solely the result of the individual's creative activity, everywhere,=20
and particularly in the highest leadership of the national com=C2=AC=20
munity, the principle of the value of the majority appears decisive,=20
and from that high place begins to gradually poison all life; that is,=20
in reality to dissolve it. The destructive effect of the Jew=E2=80=99s acti=
v=C2=AC=20
ity in other national bodies is basically attributable only to his=20
eternal efforts to undermine the position of the personality in the=20
host-peoples and to replace it by the mass. Thus, the organizing=20
principle of Aryan humanity is replaced by the destructive prin=C2=AC=20
ciple of the Jew. He becomes =E2=80=98 a ferment of decomposition =E2=80=99=
 among=20
peoples and races, and in the broader sense a dissolver of human=20
culture.=20

Marxism presents itself as the perfection of the Jew=E2=80=99s attempt=20
to exclude the pre-eminence of personality in all fields of human=20
life and replace it by the numbers of the mass. To this, in the=20
political sphere, corresponds the parliamentary form of govern=C2=AC=20
ment, which, from the smallest germ cells of the municipality up=20
to the supreme leadership of the Reich, we see in such disastrous=20
operation, and in the economic sphere, the system of a trade-=20
union movement which does not serve the real interests of the=20
workers, but exclusively the destructive purposes of the interna=C2=AC=20
tional world Jew. In precisely the measure in which the economy=20
is withdrawn from the influence of the personality principle and=20
instead exposed to the influences and effects of the masses, it=20
must lose its efficacy in serving all and benefiting all, and gradu=C2=AC=
=20
ally succumb to a sure retrogression. All the shop organizations=20
which, instead of taking into account the interests of their em=C2=AC=20
ployees, strive to gain influence on production, serve the same=20


448=20


Mein Kampe=20


purpose. They injure collective achievement, and thus in reality=20
injure individual achievement. For the satisfaction of the mem=C2=AC=20
bers of a national body does not in the long run occur exclusively=20
through mere theoretical phrases, but by the goods of daily life=20
that fall to the individual and the ultimate resultant conviction=20
that a national community in the sum of its achievement guards=20
the interests of individuals.=20

It is of no importance whether Marxism, on the basis of its=20
mass theory, seems capable of taking over and carrying on the=20
economy existing at the moment. Criticism with regard to the=20
soundness or unsoundness of this principle is not settled by the=20
proof of its capacity to administer the existing order for the=20
future, but exclusively by the proof that it can itself create a=20
higher culture. Marxism might a thousand times take over the=20
existing economy and make it continue to work under its leader=C2=AC=20
ship, but even success in this activity would prove nothing in the=20
face of the fact that it would not be in a position, by applying its=20
principle itself , to create the same thing which today it takes over=20
in a finished state.=20

Of this Marxism has furnished practical proof. Not only that=20
it has nowhere been able to found and create a culture by itself;=20
actually it has not been able to continue the existing ones in ac=C2=AC=20
cordance with its principles, but after a brief time has been forced=20
to return to the ideas embodied in the personality principle, in=20
the form of concessions; =E2=80=94 even in its own organization it cannot=
=20
dispense with these principles.=20

Thefolkish philosophy is basically distinguished from the Marxist=20
philosophy by the fact that it not only recognizes the value of race , but=
=20
with it the importance of the personality , which it therefore makes one=20
of the pillars of its entire edifice. These are the factors which sus=C2=AC=
=20
tain its view of life.=20

If the National Socialist movement did not understand the=20
fundamental importance of this basic realization, but instead were=20
merely to perform superficial patchwork on the present-day state,=20
or even adopt the mass standpoint as its own =E2=80=94 then it would=20
really constitute nothing but a party in competition with the=20


The Best State Form=20


449=20


Marxists; in that case, it would not possess the right to call itself a=20
philosophy of life. If the social program of the movement con=C2=AC=20
sisted only in pushing aside the personality and replacing it by=20
the masses, National Socialism itself would be corroded by the=20
poison of Marxism, as is the case with our bourgeois parties.=20

The folkish state must care for the welfare of its citizens by=20
recognizing in all and everything the importance of the value of=20
personality, thus in all fields preparing the way for that highest=20
measure of productive performance which grants to the individual=20
the highest measure of participation.=20

And accordingly, the folkish state must free all leadership and=20
especially the highest =E2=80=94 that is, the political leadership =E2=80=
=94 en=C2=AC=20
tirely from the parliamentary principle of majority rule =E2=80=94 in=20
other words, mass rule =E2=80=94 and instead absolutely guarantee the=20
right of the personality.=20

From this the following realization results:=20

The best state constitution and state form is that which , with the=20
most unquestioned certainty , raises the best minds in the national=20
community to leading position and leading influence.=20

But as, in economic life, the able men cannot be appointed=20
from above, but must struggle through for themselves, and just as=20
here the endless schooling, ranging from the smallest business to=20
the largest enterprise, occurs spontaneously, with life alone giving=20
the examinations, obviously political minds cannot be =E2=80=98dis=C2=AC=20
covered.=E2=80=99 Extraordinary geniuses permit of no consideration for=20
normal mankind.=20

From the smallest community cell to the highest leadership of=20
the entire Reich, the state must have the personality principle an=C2=AC=20
chored in its organization.=20

There must be no majority decisions, but only responsible per=C2=AC=20
sons, and the word =E2=80=98 council =E2=80=99 must be restored to its orig=
inal mean=C2=AC=20
ing. Surely every man will have advisers by his side, but the deci=C2=AC=20
sion will be made by one man.=20

The principle which made the Prussian army in its time into=20
the most wonderful instrument of the German people must some=20
day, in a transferred sense, become the principle of the construe-=20


450=20


Mein Kampf=20


tion of our whole state conception: authority of every leader down=C2=AC=20
ward and responsibility upward.=20

Even then it will not be possible to dispense with those cor=C2=AC=20
porations which today we designate as parliaments. But their=20
councillors will then actually give counsel; responsibility, however,=20
can and may be borne only by one man, and therefore only he=20
alone may possess the authority and right to command.=20

Parliaments as such are necessary, because in them, above=20
all, personalities to which special responsible tasks can later be=20
entrusted have an opportunity gradually to rise up.=20

This gives the following picture :=20

The folkish state, from the township up to the Reich leadership,=20
has no representative body which decides anything by the major=C2=AC=20
ity, but only advisory bodies which stand at the side of the elected=20
leader, receiving their share of work from him, and in turn if ne=C2=AC=20
cessary assuming unlimited responsibility in certain fields, just=20
as on a larger scale the leader or chairman of the various corpora=C2=AC=20
tions himself possesses.=20

As a matter of principle, the folkish state does not tolerate=20
asking advice or opinions in special matters =E2=80=94 say, of an eco=C2=AC=
=20
nomic nature =E2=80=94 of men who, on the basis of their education and=20
activity, can understand nothing of the subject. It, therefore,=20
divides its representative bodies from the start into political and=20
professional chambers.=20

In order to guarantee a profitable cooperation between the two,=20
a special senate of the elite always stands over them.=20

In no chamber and in no senate does a vote ever take place.=20
They are working institutions and not voting machines. The=20
individual member has an advisory, but never a determining,=20
voice. The latter is the exclusive privilege of the responsible=20
chairman.=20

This principle =E2=80=94 absolute responsibility unconditionally com=C2=AC=
=20
bined with absolute authority =E2=80=94 will gradually breed an elite of=20
leaders such as today, in this era of irresponsible parliamentarian-=20
ism, is utterly inconceivable.=20

Thus, the political form of the nation will be brought into=20


National Socialism and the Coming State 451=20

agreement with that law to which it owes its greatness in the cul=C2=AC=20
tural and economic field.=20

# # #=20

As regards the possibility of putting these ideas into practice,=20
I beg you not to forget that the parliamentary principle of=20
democratic majority rule has by no means always dominated=20
mankind, but on the contrary is to be found only in brief periods=20
of history, which are always epochs of the decay of peoples and=20
states.=20

But it should not be believed that such a transformation can=20
be accomplished by purely theoretical measures from above, since=20
logically it may not even stop at the state constitution, but must=20
permeate all other legislation, and indeed all civil life. Such a=20
fundamental change can and will only take place through a move=C2=AC=20
ment which is itself constructed in the spirit of these ideas and=20
hence bears the future state within itself.=20

Hence the National Socialist movement should today adapt=20
itself entirely to these ideas and carry them to practical fruition=20
within its own organization, so that some day it may not only=20
show the state these same guiding principles, but can also place=20
the completed body of its own state at its disposal.=20


CHAPTER=20

V=20


Philosophy and Organization=20


jL he folkish state, a general picture of=20
which I have attempted to draw in broad outlines, will not be=20
realized by the mere knowledge of what is necessary to this state.=20
It is not enough to know how a folkish state should look. Far=20
more important is the program for its creation. We may not=20
expect the present parties, which after all are primarily bene=C2=AC=20
ficiaries of the present state, to arrive of their own accord at a=20
change of orientation and of their own free will to modify their=20
present attitude. What makes this all the more impossible is=20
that their real leading elements are always Jews and only Jews.=20
And the development we are going through today, if continued=20
unobstructed, would fulfill the Jewish prophecy =E2=80=94 the Jew would=20
really devour the peoples of the earth, would become their=20
master.=20

Thus, confronting the millions of German =E2=80=98 bourgeois=E2=80=99 and=
=20
=E2=80=98proletarians,=E2=80=99 who for the most part, from cowardice coupl=
ed=20
with stupidity, trot toward their ruin, he pursues his way in=C2=AC=20
exorably, in the highest consciousness of his future goal. A party=20
which is led by him can, therefore, stand for no other interests=20
beside his interests; and with the concerns of Aryan nations,=20
these have nothing in common.=20

And so, if we wish to transform the ideal image of a folkish=20
state into practical reality, we must, independent of the powers=20
that have thus far ruled public life, seek a new force that is=20


Struggle and Criticism=20


453=20


willing and able to take up the struggle for such an idea. For=20
it will take a struggle, in view of the fact that the first task is=20
not creation of a folkish state conception, but above all elimina=C2=AC=20
tion of the existing Jewish one. As so frequently in history, the=20
main difficulty lies, not in the form of the new state of things,=20
but in making place for it. Prejudices and interests unite in a=20
solid phalanx and attempt with all possible means to prevent the=20
victory of an idea that is displeasing to them or that menaces=20
them.=20

And so, unfortunately, the fighter for such a new idea, impor=C2=AC=20
tant as it may be to put positive emphasis on it, is forced to=20
carry through first of all the negative part of the fight, that part=20
which should lead to the elimination of the present state of affairs.=20

A young doctrine of great and new fundamental significance=20
will, displeasing as this may be to the individual, be forced to=20
employ as its first weapon the probe of criticism in all its sharp=C2=AC=20
ness.=20

It indicates a lack of deep insight into historical developments=20
when today people who call themselves folkish make a great=20
point of assuring us over and over that they do not plan to=20
engage in negative criticism , but only in constructive work; this=20
absurd childish stammering is =E2=80=98folkish=E2=80=99 in the worst sense =
and=20
snows how little trace the history even of their own times has=20
left in these minds. Marxism also had a goal, and it, too, has a=20
constructive activity (even if it is only to erect a despotism of=20
international world Jewish finance); but previously, neverthe=C2=AC=20
less, it practiced criticism for seventy years , annihilating, disinte=C2=
=AC=20
grating criticism, and again criticism, which continued until the=20
old state was undermined by this persistent corrosive acid and=20
brought to collapse. Only then did its actual =E2=80=98 construction =E2=80=
=99 begin.=20
And that was self-evident, correct and logical. An existing con=C2=AC=20
dition is not eliminated just by emphasizing and arguing for a=20
future one. For it is not to be presumed that the adherents, let=20
alone the beneficiaries of the condition now existing, could all=20
be converted and won over to the new one merely by demon=C2=AC=20
strating its necessity. On the contrary, it is only too possible=20


454=20


Mein Kampf=20


that in this case two conditions will remain in existence side=20
by side, and that the so-called philosophy will become a party ,=20
unable to raise itself above its limitations. For the philosophy is=20
intolerant; it cannot content itself with the role of one 1 party=20
beside others/ but imperiously demands, not only its own exclu=C2=AC=20
sive and unlimited recognition, but the complete transformation=20
of all public life in accordance with its views. It can, therefore,=20
not tolerate the simultaneous continuance of a body represent=C2=AC=20
ing the former condition.=20

This is equally true of religions.=20

Christianity could not content itself with building up its own=20
altar; it was absolutely forced to undertake the destruction of=20
the heathen altars. Only from this fanatical intolerance could its=20
apodictic faith take form; this intolerance is, in fact, its absolute=20
presupposition.=20

The objection may very well be raised that such phenomena in=20
world history arise for the most part from specifically Jewish=20
modes of thought, in fact, that this type of intolerance and=20
fanaticism positively embodies the Jewish nature. This may be=20
a thousand times true; we may deeply regret this fact and estab=C2=AC=20
lish with justifiable loathing that its appearance in the history=20
of mankind is something that was previously alien to history =E2=80=94=20
yet this does not alter the fact that this condition is with us=20
today. The men who want to redeem our German people from=20
its present condition have no need to worry their heads thinking=20
how lovely it would be if this and that did not exist; they must=20
try to ascertain how the given condition can be eliminated. A=20
philosophy filled with infernal intolerance will only be broken=20
by a new idea, driven forward by the same spirit, championed=20
by the same mighty will, and at the same time pure and abso=C2=AC=20
lutely genuine in itself.=20

The individual may establish with pain today that with the=20
appearance of Christianity the first spiritual terror entered into=20
the far freer ancient world, but he will not be able to contest the=20
fact that since then the world has been afflicted and dominated=20
by this coercion, and that coercion is broken only by coercion,=20


Parties Tend to Compromise=20


455=20


and terror only by terror. Only then can a new state of affairs=20
be constructively created.=20

Political parties are inclined to compromises; philosophies never.=20
Political parties even reckon with opponents; philosophies proclaim=20
their infallibility.=20

Political parties, too, almost always have the original purpose=20
of attaining exclusive despotic domination; a slight impulse=20
toward a philosophy is almost always inherent in them. Yet the=20
very narrowness of their program robs them of the heroism which=20
a philosophy demands. The conciliatory nature of their will=20
attracts small and weakly spirits with which no crusades can be=20
fought. And so, for the most part, they soon bog down in their=20
own pitiful pettiness: They abandon the struggle for a philosophy=20
and attempt instead, by so-called 1 positive collaboration / to con=C2=AC=
=20
quer as quickly as possible a little place at the feeding trough of=20
existing institutions and to keep it as long as possible. That is=20
their entire endeavor. And if they should be pushed away from=20
the general feeding crib by a somewhat brutal competing boarder,=20
their thoughts and actions are directed solely, whether by force=20
or trickery, toward pushing their way back to the front of the=20
hungry herd and finally, even at the cost of their holy conviction,=20
toward refreshing themselves at the beloved swill pail. Jackals=20
of politics!=20

Since a philosophy of life is never willing to share with another ,=20
it cannot be willing either to collaborate in an existing regime=20
which it condemns, but feels obligated to combat this regime=20
and the whole hostile world of ideas with all possible means;=20
that is, to prepare its downfall.=20

This purely destructive fight =E2=80=94 the danger of which is at once=20
recognized by all others and which consequently encounters=20
general resistance =E2=80=94 as well as the positive struggle, attacking to=
=20
make way for its own world of ideas, requires determined fighters.=20
And so a philosophy will lead its idea to victory only if it unites=20
the most courageous and energetic elements of its epoch and=20
people in its ranks, and puts them into the solid forms of a fight=C2=AC=20
ing organization. For this, however, taking these elements into=20


456=20


Mein Kampe=20


consideration, it must pick out certain ideas from its general=20
World picture and clad them in a form which, in its precise,=20
slogan-like brevity, seems suited to serve as a creed for a new=20
community of men. While the program of a solely political party=20
is the formula for a healthy outcome of the next elections, the=20
program of a philosophy is the formulation of a declaration of war=20
against the existing order, against a definite state of affairs; in=20
short, against an existing view of life in general.=20

It is not necessary that every individual fighting for this phil=C2=AC=20
osophy should obtain a full insight and precise knowledge of the=20
ultimate ideas and thought processes of the leaders of the move=C2=AC=20
ment. What is necessary is that some few, really great ideas be=20
made clear to him, and that the essential fundamental lines be=20
burned inextinguishably into him, so that he is entirely permeated=20
by the necessity of the victory of his movement and its doctrine.=20
The individual soldier is not initiated into the thought processes=20
of higher strategy either. He is, on the contrary, trained in=20
rigid discipline and fanatical faith in the justice and power of=20
his cause, and taught to stake his life for it without reservation;=20
the same must occur with the individual adherent of a move=C2=AC=20
ment of great scope, great future, and the greatest will.=20

Useless as an army would be, whose individual soldiers were=20
all generals, even if it were only by virtue of their education and=20
their insight, equally useless is a political movement, fighting for=20
a philosophy , if it is only a reservoir of =E2=80=98 bright , people. No, =
it=20
also needs the primitive soldier, since otherwise an inner discipline=20
is unobtainable.=20

It lies in the nature of an organization that it can only exist=20
if a broad mass, with a more emotional attitude, serves a high=20
intellectual leadership. A company of two hundred men of equal=20
intellectual ability would in the long run be harder to discipline=20
than a company of a hundred and ninety intellectually less capa=C2=AC=20
ble men and ten with higher education.=20

Social Democracy in its day drew the greatest profit from this=20
fact. It took members of the broad masses, discharged from=20
military service where they had been trained in discipline, and=20


Leadership and Following=20


457=20


drew them into its equally rigid party discipline. And its organ=C2=AC=20
ization represented an army of officers and soldiers. The German=20
manual worker became the soldier, the Jewish intellectual the=20
officer; and the German trade-union officials can be regarded as=20
the corps of noncommissioned officers. The thing which our=20
bourgeoisie always viewed with headshaking, the fact that only=20
the so-called uneducated masses belonged to the Marxist move=C2=AC=20
ment, was in reality the basis for its success. For while the=20
bourgeois parties with their one-sided intellectualism constituted=20
a worthless undisciplined band, the Marxists with their unin=C2=AC=20
tellectual human material formed an army of party soldiers,=20
who obeyed their Jewish leader as blindly as formerly their=20
German officer. The German bourgeoisie, which as a matter of=20
principle never concerned itself with psychological problems be=C2=AC=20
cause it stood so high above them, found it, here too, unnecessary=20
to reflect, and recognize the deeper meaning, as well as the secret=20
danger, of this fact. They thought, on the contrary, that a=20
political movement, formed only from the circles of the =E2=80=98intelli=C2=
=AC=20
gentsia, =E2=80=99 is for this very reason more valuable and possesses a=20
greater claim, in fact a greater likelihood, of taking over the=20
government than the uneducated masses. They never understood=20
that the strength of a political party lies by no means in the greatest=20
possible independent intellect of the individual members , but rather=20
in the disciplined obedience with which its members follow the in=C2=AC=20
tellectual leadership. The decisive factor is the leadership itself.=20
If two bodies of troops battle each other, the one to conquer=20
will not be the one in which every individual has received the=20
highest strategic training, but that one which has the most=20
superior leadership and at the same time the most disciplined^=20
blindly obedient, best-drilled troop.=20

This is the basic insight which we must constantly bear in=20
mind in examining the possibility of transforming a philosophy=20
into action.=20

And so, if, in order to carry a philosophy to victory, we must=20
transform it into a fighting movement, logically the program of=20
the movement must take into consideration the human material=20


458=20


Mein Kampe=20


that stands at its disposal. As immutable as the ultimate aims=20
and the leading ideas must be, with equal wisdom and psychologi=C2=AC=20
cal soundness the recruiting program must be adapted to the=20
minds of those without whose aid the most beautiful idea would=20
remain eternally an idea.=20

If the folkish idea wants to arrive at a clear success from the=20
unclear will of today, it must pick out from the broad world of Us=20
ideas certain guiding principles, suited in their essence and content=20
to binding a broad mass of men, that mass which alone guarantees=20
the struggle for this idea as laid down in our philosophy.=20

Therefore, the program of the new movement was summed up=20
in a few guiding principles, twenty-five in all. They were devised=20
to give, primarily to the man of the people, a rough picture of=20
the movement=E2=80=99s aims. They are in a sense a political creed, which=
=20
on the one hand recruits for the movement and on'the other is=20
suited to unite and weld together by a commonly recognized=20
obligation those who have been recruited.=20

Here the following insight must never leave us: Since the=20
so-called program of the movement is absolutely correct in its=20
ultimate aims, but in its formulation had to take psychological=20
forces into account, in the course of time the conviction may well=20
arise that in individual instances certain of the guiding principles=20
ought perhaps to be framed differently, given a better formula=C2=AC=20
tion. Every attempt to do this, however, usually works out=20
catastrophically. For in this way something which should be=20
unshakable is submitted to discussion, which, as soon as a single=20
point is deprived of its dogmatic, creedlike formulation, will not=20
automatically yield a new, better, and above all unified, formula=C2=AC=20
tion, but will far sooner lead to endless debates and a general=20
confusion. In such a case, it always remains to be considered=20
which is better: a new, happier formulation which causes an=20
argument within the movement, or a form which at the moment=20
may not be the very best, but which represents a solid, unshak=C2=AC=20
able, inwardly unified organism. And any examination will show=20
that the latter is preferable. For, since in changes it is always=20
merely the outward formulation tha* is involved, such correc-=20


Guiding Principles of the Movement 459=20

tions will again and again seem possible or desirable. Finally , in=20
view of the superficial character of men , there is the great danger=20
that they will see the essential task of a movement in this purely=20
outward formulation of a program . Then the will and the power=20
to fight for an idea recede, and the activity which should turn=20
outward will wear itself out in inner programmatic squabbles.=20

With a doctrine that is really sound in its broad outlines, it=20
is less harmful to retain a formulation, even if it should not=20
entirely correspond to reality, than by improving it to expose=20
what hitherto seemed a granite principle of the movement to=20
general discussion with all its evil consequences. Above all, it is=20
impossible as long as a movement is still fighting for victory.=20
For how shall we fill people with blind faith in the correctness=20
of a doctrine, if we ourselves spread uncertainty and doubt by=20
constant changes in its outward structure?=20

The truth is that the most essential substance must never be=20
sought in the outward formulation, but only and always in the=20
inner sense. This is immutable; and in the interest of this im=C2=AC=20
mutable inner sense, we can only wish that the movement pre=C2=AC=20
serve the necessary strength to fight for it by avoiding all actions=20
that splinter and create uncertainty.=20

Here, too, we can learn by the example of the Catholic Church.=20
Though its doctrinal edifice, and in part quite superfluously,=20
comes into collision with exact science and research, it is none the=20
less unwilling to sacrifice so much as one little syllable of its=20
dogmas. It has recognized quite correctly that its power of re=C2=AC=20
sistance does not lie in its lesser or greater adaptation to the=20
scientific findings of the moment, which in reality are always=20
fluctuating, but rather in rigidly holding to dogmas once estab=C2=AC=20
lished, for it is only such dogmas which lend to the whole body=20
the character of a faith. And so today it stands more firmly=20
than ever. It can be prophesied that in exactly the same measure=20
in which appearances evade us, it will gain more and more blind=20
support as a static pole amid the flight of appearances . 1=20

lc Der ruhende Pol in der Erscheinungen FluchP (the s tatic pole in the=20
flight of appearances). A familiar quotation. From Schiller=E2=80=99s Der S=
pazier -=20

Mein Kampf=20


And so, anyone who really and seriously desires the victory of a=20
folkish philosophy must not only recognize that, for the achievement=20
of such a success in the first place, only a movement capable of struggle=
=20
is suitable, but that, in the second place, such a movement itself will=20
stand firm only if based on unshakable certainty and firmness in its=20
program. It must not run the risk of making concessions in its=20
formulation to the momentary spirit of the times, but must retain=20
forever a form that has once been found favorable, in any case until=20
crowned by victory. Before that, any attempt to bring about argu=C2=AC=20
ments as to the expediency of this or that point in the program=20
splinters the solidity and the fighting force of the movement,=20
proportionately as its adherents participate in such an inner dis=C2=AC=20
cussion. This does not mean that an =E2=80=98improvement 5 carried out=20
today might not tomorrow be subjected to renewed critical tests,=20
only to find a better substitute the day after tomorrow. Once=20
you tear down barriers in this connection, you open a road, the=20
beginning of which is known, but whose end is lost in the infinite.=20

This important realization had to be applied in the young=20
National Socialist movement. The National Socialist German=20
Workers' Party obtained with its program of twenty-five theses a=20
foundation which must remain unshakable. The task of the present=20
and future members of our movement must not consist in a=20
critical revision of these theses, but rather in being bound by=20
them. For otherwise the next generation in turn could, with the=20
same right, squander its strength on such purely formal work=20
within the party, instead of recruiting new adherents and thereby=20
new forces for the movement. For the great number of the ad=C2=AC=20
herents, the essence of our movement will consist less in the letter=20
of our theses than in the meaning which we are able to give them.=20

It was to these realizations that the young movement owed its=20
name; the program was later framed according to them and, further=C2=AC=20
more, the manner of their dissemination is based on them. In order=20
to help the folkish ideas to victory, a party of the people had to be=20
created, a party which consists not only of intellectual leaders, but=20
also of manual workers!=20

Any attempt to realize folkish ideas without such a militant=20


National Socialism and the Folkish Idea 461=20

organization would today , just as in the past and in the eternal=20
future , remain without success. And so the movement has not=20
only the right , but also the duty , of regarding itself as a pioneer=20
and representative of these ideas. To the same degree as the=20
basic ideas of the National Socialist movement are folkish , the=20
folkish ideas are National Socialist. And if National Socialism=20
wants to conquer, it must unconditionally and exclusively espouse=20
this truth. Here, too, it has not only the right , but also the duty,=20
of sharply emphasizing the fact that any attempt to put forward=20
the folkish idea outside the framework of the National Socialist=20
German Workers=E2=80=99 Party is impossible, and in most cases based=20
on a positive swindle.=20

If today anyone reproaches the movement for acting as if=20
the folkish idea were their monopoly, there is but one answer;=20

Not only a monopoly , hut a working monopoly.=20

For what previously existed under this concept was not suited=20
to influence the destiny of our people even in the slightest, since=20
all these ideas lacked a clear and coherent formulation. For the=20
most part there were single , disconnected ideas of greater or lesser=20
soundness, not seldom standing in mutual contradiction, in no=20
case having any inner tie between them. And even had such a=20
tie been present, in its weakness it would never have sufficed to=20
orientate and build a movement on.=20

Only the National Socialist movement accomplished this.=20

word would have meant nothing to them, and especially their=20
leading minds would have stood in no relation of any sort to=20
this concept. Only the work of the NSDAP for the first time=20
made this concept a word full of content, which is now taken up=20
by every conceivable kind of people; above all, in its own success-=20

fill campaigning activity, it snowed and demonstrated the force=20
of these folkish ideas, so that mere desire to get ahead forces the=20
others, ostensibly at least, to desire similar ends.=20

Just as hitherto they used everything for their petty election=20
speculation, the folkish concept has today remained for them=20
only an external empty slogan with which they attempt to=20
counterbalance, among their own members, the attractive force=20
of the National Socialist movement. For it is only concern for=20
their own existence as well as fear of the rise of our new phi=C2=AC=20
losophy-borne movement, whose universal importance as well as=20
its dangerous exclusiveness they sense, that puts into their=20
mouth words which eight years ago they did not know, seven=20
years ago ridiculed, six years ago branded as absurd, five years=20
ago combated, four years ago hated, three years ago persecuted,=20
only at length to annex them two years ago, and, combined with=20
the rest of their vocabulary, to use them as a battle-cry in the=20
fight.=20

And even today we must point out again and again that all=20
these parties lack the slightest idea of what the German people=20
needs. The most striking proof of this is the superficiality with=20
which they mouth the word =E2=80=98folkish/=20

And no less dangerous are all those who horse around pretend=C2=AC=20
ing to be folkish, forge fantastic plans, for the most part based=20
on nothing but some idee fixe , which in itself might be sound, but=20
in its isolation remains none the less without any importance for=20
the formation of a great unified fighting community, and in no=20
case is suited to building one. These people, who partly from=20
their own thinking, partly from what they have read, brew up a=20
program, are frequently more dangerous than the open enemies=20
of the folkish idea. In the best case they are sterile theoreticians,=20
but for the most part disastrous braggarts, and not seldom they=20
believe that with flowing beards and primeval Teutonic gestures=20
they can mask the intellectual and mental hollowness of their=20
activities and abilities.=20

In contrast to all these useless attempts, it is therefore good=20
if we recall to mind the time in which the young National Socialist=20
movement began its struggle.=20

JL he first great meeting on February 24,=20
1920, in the Festsaal [Banquet Hall] of the Hofbrauhaus, had=20
not died down in our ears when the preparations for the next were=20
made. While up till then it had been considered risky to hold a=20
little meeting once a month or even once every two weeks in a=20
city like Munich, a large mass meeting was now to take place=20
every seven days; in other words, once a week. I do not need to=20
assure you that there was but one fear that constantly tormented=20
us: would the people come and would they listen to us? =E2=80=94 though=20
I personally, even then, had the unshakable conviction that once=20
they were there, the people would stay and follow the speech.=20

In this period the Festsaal of the Munich Hofbrauhaus assumed=20
an almost sacred significance for us National Socialists. Every=20
week a meeting, almost always in this room, and each time the=20
hall better filled, and the people more devoted. Beginning with=20
the =E2=80=98War Guilt/ which at that time nobody bothered about,=20
and the =E2=80=98Peace Treaties/ nearly everything was taken up that=20
seemed agitationally expedient or ideologically necessary. Es=C2=AC=20
pecially to the peace treaties themselves the greatest attention=20
was given. What prophecies the young movement kept making=20
to the great masses! And nearly all of which have now been=20
realized! Today it is easy to speak or write about these things.=20
But in those days a public mass meeting, attended, not by=20
bourgeois shopkeepers, but by incited proletarians, and dealing=20


464=20


Mein Kampf=20


with the topic, =E2=80=98The Peace Treaty of Versailles/ was taken as an=20
attack on the Republic and a sign of a reactionary if not monar-=20
chistic attitude. At the very first sentence containing a criticism of=20
Versailles, you had the stereotyped cry flung at you: =E2=80=98What about=
=20
Brest-Litovsk ? 9 =E2=80=98And Brest-Litovsk?=E2=80=99 The masses roared th=
is=20
again and again, until gradually they grew hoarse or the speaker=20
finally gave up his attempt to convince them. You felt like dash=C2=AC=20
ing your head against the wall in despair over such people!=20
They did not want to hear or understand that Versailles was a=20
shame and a disgrace, and not even that this dictated peace was=20
an unprecedented pillaging of our people. The destructive work=20
of the Marxists and the poison of enemy propaganda had de=C2=AC=20
prived the people of any sense. And yet we had not even the=20
right to complain! For how immeasurably great was the blame=20
on another side! What had the bourgeoisie done to'put a halt=20
to this frightful disintegration, to oppose it and open the way=20
to truth by a better and more thorough enlightenment? Nothing,=20
and again nothing. In those days I saw them nowhere, all the=20
great folkish apostles of today. Perhaps they spoke in little clubs,=20
at teatables, or in circles of like-minded people, but where they=20
should have been, among the wolves, they did not venture; except=20
if there was a chance to howl with the pack.=20

But to me it was clear in those days that for the small basic=20
nucleus which for the present constituted the movement, the=20
question of war guilt had to be cleared up, and cleared up in the=20
sense of historic truth. That our movement should transmit to=20
the broadest masses knowledge of the peace treaty was the prem=C2=AC=20
ise for the future success of the movement. At that time, when=20
they all still regarded this peace as a success of democracy, we=20
had to form a front against it and engrave ourselves forever in=20
the minds of men as an enemy of this treaty, so that later, when=20
the harsh reality of this treacherous frippery would be revealed=20
in its naked hate, the recollection of our position at that time=20
would win us confidence.=20

Even then I always came out in favor of taking a position in=20
important questions of principle against all public opinion when=20


Against the Stream=20


465=20


it assumed a false attitude =E2=80=94 disregarding all considerations of=20
popularity; hatred, or struggle. The NSDAP should not become=20
a constable of public opinion, but must dominate it. It must not=20
become a servant of the masses, but their master!=20

There exists, of course, and especially for every movement that=20
is still weak, a great temptation, in moments when a more power=C2=AC=20
ful enemy has succeeded in driving the people to a mad decision=20
or to a false attitude through his arts of seduction, to go along=20
and join the shouting, particularly when there are a few reasons =E2=80=94=
=20
even if they are merely illusory =E2=80=94 which, from the standpoint of=20
the young movement itself, might argue for this course. Human=20
cowardice will seek such reasons so vigorously that it almost=20
always finds something which would give a semblance of justi=C2=AC=20
fication, even from one=E2=80=99s =E2=80=98own standpoint,=E2=80=99 for par=
ticipating in=20
such a crime.=20

I have several times experienced such cases, in which supreme=20
energy was necessary to keep the ship of the movement from=20
drifting with the artificially aroused general current or rather=20
from being driven by it. The last time was when our infernal=20
press, to which the existence of the German people is Hecuba,=20
succeeded in puffing up the South Tyrol question to an impor=C2=AC=20
tance which will be catastrophic for the German people. Without=20
considering whom they were serving thereby, many so-called=20
=E2=80=98national=E2=80=99 men and parties and organizations, solely from=
=20
cowardice in the face of Jew-incited public opinion, joined the=20
general outcry and senselessly helped to support the fight against=20
a system which we Germans, precisely in this present-day situa=C2=AC=20
tion, must feel to be the sole ray of light in this degenerating=20
world. While the international world Jew slowly but surely=20
strangles us, our so-called patriots shouted against a man and a=20
system which dared, in one corner of the earth at least, to free=20
themselves from the Jewish-Masonic embrace and oppose a na=C2=AC=20
tionalistic resistance to this international world poisoning. It=20
was, however, too alluring for weak characters simply to set=20
their sails by the wind and capitulate to the clamor of public=20
opinion. And a capitulation it was! Men are such base liars that=20


466=20


Mein Kampf=20


they may not admit it, even to themselves, but it remains the=20
truth that only cowardice and fear of the popular sentiment=20
stirred up by the Jews impelled them to join in. All other explana=C2=AC=20
tions are miserable evasions devised by the petty sinner conscious=20
of his guilt.=20

And so it was necessary to shake the movement with an iron=20
fist to preserve it from ruin by this tendency. To attempt such=20
a shift at a moment when public opinion, fanned by every=20
driving force, was burning only in one direction is indeed not=20
very popular at the moment and sometimes puts the venture=C2=AC=20
some leader in almost mortal peril. But not a few men in history=20
have at such moments been stoned for an action for which pos=C2=AC=20
terity, at a later date, had every cause to thank them on its knees.=20

It is with this that a movement must reckon and not with the=20
momentary approval of the present. It may be that in such=20
hours the individual feels afraid; but he must not forget that=20
after every such hour salvation comes at length, and that a=20
movement that wants to renew a world must serve, not the=20
moment, but the future.=20

In this connection it can be established that the greatest and=20
most enduring successes in history tend for the most part to be=20
those which in their beginnings found the least understanding=20
because they stood in the sharpest conflict with general public=20
opinion, with its ideas and its will.=20

Even then, on the first day of our public appearance, we had a=20
chance to experience this. Truly we did not =E2=80=98 curry favor with=20
the masses/ but everywhere opposed the lunacy of these people.=20
Nearly always it came about that in these years I faced an as*=20
semblage of people who believed the opposite of what I wanted=20
to say, and wanted the opposite of what I believed. Then it was=20
the work of two hours to lift tw T o or three thousand people out=20
of a previous conviction, blow by blow to shatter the foundation=20
of their previous opinions, and finally to lead them across to our=20
convictions and our philosophy of life.=20

In those days I learned something important in a short time,=20
to strike the weapon of reply out of the enemy's hand myself . We=20


Enlightenment on the Peace Treaties 467=20

soon noticed that our opponents, especially their discussion=20
speakers, stepped forward with a definite =E2=80=98 repertory =E2=80=99 in =
which=20
constantly recurring objections to our assertions were raised, so=20
that the uniformity of this procedure pointed to a conscious,=20
unified schooling. And that was indeed the case. Here we had an=20
opportunity to become acquainted with the incredible discipline=20
of our adversaries=E2=80=99 propaganda, and it is still my pride today to=
=20
have found the means, not only to render this propaganda ineffec=C2=AC=20
tive, but in the end to strike its makers with their own weapon=20
Two years later I was a master of this art.=20

In every single speech it was important to realize clearly in=20
advance the presumable content and form of the objections to be=20
expected in the discussion, and to pull every one of them apart=20
in the speech itself. Here it was expedient to cite the possible=20
objections ourselves at the outset and demonstrate their unten-=20
ability; thus, the listener, even if he had come stuffed full of the=20
objections he had been taught, but otherwise with an honest=20
heart, was more easily won over when we disposed of the doubts=20
that had been imprinted on his memory. The stuff that had been=20
drummed into him was automatically refuted and his attention=20
drawn more and more to the speech.=20

This is the reason why, right after my first lecture on the=20
f Peace Treaty of Versailles/ which I had delivered to the troops=20
while still a so-called * educator/ I changed the lecture and now=20
spoke of the =E2=80=98 Peace Treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Versailles.=E2=
=80=99=20
For after a short time, in fact, in the course of the discussion=20
about this first speech of mine, I was able to ascertain that the=20
people really knew T nothing at all about the peace treaty of Brest-=20
Litovsk, but that the adroit propaganda of their parties had=20
succeeded in representing thiy very treaty as one of the most=20
shameful acts of rape in the world. The persistence with which=20
this lie was presented over and over to the great masses accounted=20
for the fact that millions of Germans regarded the peace treaty=20
of Versailles as nothing more than just retribution for the crime=20
committed by us at Brest-Litovsk, thus viewing any real struggle=20
against Versailles as an injustice and sometimes remaining in the=20


468=20


Mein Kampf=20


sincerest moral indignation. And this among other things was=20
why the shameless and monstrous word =E2=80=98 reparations=E2=80=99 was abl=
e=20
to make itself at home in Germany. This vile hypocrisy really=20
seemed to millions of our incited national comrades an accom=C2=AC=20
plishment of higher justice. Dreadful, but it was so. The best=20
proof of' this was offered by the propaganda I initiated against=20
the peace treaty of Versailles, which I introduced by some en=C2=AC=20
lightenment regarding the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. I contrasted=20
the two peace treaties, compared them point for point, showed the=20
actual boundless humanity of the one treaty compared to the=20
inhuman cruelty of the second, and the result was telling. At=20
that time I spoke on this theme at meetings of two thousand=20
people, and often I was struck by the glances of three thousand=20
six hundred hostile eyes. And three hours later I had before me a=20
surging mass full of the holiest indignation and boundless wrath.=20
Again a great lie had been torn out of the hearts and brains of a=20
crowd numbering thousands, and a truth implanted in its place.=20

I considered these two lectures on =E2=80=98The True Causes of the=20
World War=E2=80=99 and on =E2=80=98The Peace Treaties of Brest-Litovsk and=
=20
Versailles,=E2=80=99 the most important of all, and so I repeated and re=C2=
=AC=20
peated them dozens of times, always renewing the form, until,=20
on this point at least, a certain clear and unified conception be=C2=AC=20
came current among the people from among whom the move=C2=AC=20
ment gathered its first members.=20

For myself, moreoever, the meetings had the advantage that=20
I gradually transformed myself into a speaker for mass meetings,=20
that I became practiced in the pathos and the gestures which a=20
great hall, with its thousands of people, demands.=20

At that time, except =E2=80=94 as already emphasized =E2=80=94 in small=20
circles, I saw no enlightenment in this direction from the parties=20
which today have their mouths so full of words and act as if they=20
had brought about the change in public opinion. When a so-called=20
=E2=80=98national politician =E2=80=99 somewhere delivered a speech along t=
hese=20
lines, it was only to circles who for the most part already shared=20
his conviction, and for whom his utterances represented at most=20
an intensification of their own opinions. This was not the im-=20


Strength of the Spoken Word=20


469=20


portant thing at that time; the important thing was to win by=20
enlightenment and propaganda those people who, by virtue of=20
their education and opinions, still stood on hostile ground.=20

The leaflet, too, was put into the service of this enlightenment.=20
While still in the army, I had written a leaflet comparing the=20
peace treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Versailles , and it was dis=C2=AC=20
tributed in large editions. Later I took over stocks of it for the=20
party, and here again the effect was good. The first meetings,=20
in general, were distinguished by the fact that the tables were=20
covered with all sorts of leaflets, newspapers, pamphlets, etc.=20
But the chief emphasis was laid on the spoken word. And ac=C2=AC=20
tually it alone =E2=80=94 for general psychological reasons =E2=80=94 is ab=
le to=20
bring about really great changes.=20

I have already stated in the first volume that all great, world=C2=AC=20
shaking events have been brought about, not by written matter,=20
but by the spoken word. This led to a lengthy discussion in a=20
part of the press, where, of course, such an assertion was sharply=20
attacked, particularly by our bourgeois wiseacres. But the very=20
reason why this occurred confutes the doubters. For the bour=C2=AC=20
geois intelligentsia protest against such a view only because they=20
themselves obviously lack the power and ability to influence the=20
masses by the spoken word, since they have thrown themselves=20
more and more into purely literary activity and renounced the=20
real agitational activity of the spoken word. Such habits neces=C2=AC=20
sarily lead in time to what distinguishes our bourgeoisie today;=20
that is, to the loss of the psychological instinct for mass effect and=20
mass influence.=20

While the speaker gets a continuous correction of his speech=20
from the crowd he is addressing, since he can always see in the=20
faces of his listeners to what extent they can follow his arguments=20
with understanding and whether the impression and the effect of=20
his words lead to the desired goal =E2=80=94 the writer does not know his=
=20
readers at all. Therefore, to begin with, he will not aim at a=20
definite mass before his eyes, but will keep his arguments entirely=20
general. By this to a certain degree he loses psychological subtlety=20
and in consequence suppleness. And so, by and large, a brilliant=20


470=20


Mein Kampf=20


speaker will be able to write better than a brilliant writer can=20
speak, unless he continuously practices this art. On top of this=20
there is the fact that the mass of people as such is lazy; that they=20
remain inertly in the spirit of their old habits and, left to them=C2=AC=20
selves, will take up a piece of written matter only reluctantly if=20
it is not in agreement with what they themselves believe and=20
does not bring them what they had hoped for. Therefore, an=20
article with a definite tendency is for the most part read only=20
by people who can already be reckoned to this tendency. At=20
most a leaflet or a poster can, by its brevity, count on getting a=20
moment=E2=80=99s attention from someone who thinks differently. The=20
picture in all its forms up to the film has greater possibilities.=20
Here a man needs to use his brains even less; it suffices to iookj=20
or at most to read extremely brief texts, and thus many will=20
more readily accept a pictorial presentation than read an article=20
of any length. The picture brings them in a much briefer time,=20
I might almost say at one stroke, the enlightenment which they=20
obtain from written matter only after arduous reading.=20

The essential point, however, is that a piece of literature never=20
knows into what hands it will fall, and yet must retain its definite=20
form. In general the effect will be the greater, the more this=20
form corresponds to the intellectual level and nature of those=20
very people who will be its readers. A book that is destined for=20
the broad masses must, therefore, attempt from the very begin=C2=AC=20
ning to have an effect, both in style and elevation, different from=20
a work intended for higher intellectual classes.=20

Only by this kind of adaptability does written matter approach=20
the spoken word. To my mind, the speaker can treat the same=20
theme as the book; he will, if he is a brilliant popular orator, not=20
be likely to repeat the same reproach and the same substance=20
twice in the same form. He will always let himself be borne by=20
the great masses in such a way that instinctively the very words=20
come to his lips that he needs to speak to the hearts of his audi=C2=AC=20
ence. And if he errs, even in the slightest, he has the living cor=C2=AC=20
rection before him. As I have said, he can read from the facial=20
expression of his audience whether, firstly, they understand what=20


Strength of the Spoken Word=20


471=20


he is saying, whether, secondly, they can follow the speech as a=20
whole , and to what extent, thirdly, he has convinced them of the=20
soundness of what he has said. If =E2=80=94 firstly =E2=80=94 he sees that =
they=20
do not understand him, he will become so primitive and clear in=20
his explanations that even the last member of his audience has to=20
understand him; if he feels =E2=80=94 secondly =E2=80=94 that they cannot=
=20
follow him, he will construct his ideas so cautiously and slowly=20
that even the weakest member of the audience is not left behind,=20
and he will =E2=80=94 thirdly =E2=80=94 if he suspects that they do not see=
m=20
convinced of the soundness of his argument, repeat it over and=20
over in constantly new examples. He himself will utter their=20
objections, which he senses though unspoken, and go on confut=C2=AC=20
ing them and exploding them, until at length even the last group=20
of an opposition, by its very bearing and facial expression, en=C2=AC=20
ables him to recognize its capitulation to his arguments.=20

Here again it is not seldom a question of overcoming prejudices=20
which are not based on reason, but, for the most part uncon=C2=AC=20
sciously, are supported only by sentiment. To overcome this=20
barrier of instinctive aversion, of emotional hatred, of prejudiced=20
rejection, is a thousand times harder than to correct a faulty or=20
erroneous scientific opinion. False concepts and poor knowledge=20
can be eliminated by instruction, the resistance of the emotions=20
never. Here only an appeal to these mysterious powers them=C2=AC=20
selves can be effective; and the writer can hardly ever accomplish=20
this, but almost exclusively the orator.=20

The most striking proof of this is furnished by the fact that,=20
despite a bourgeois press that is often very skillfully 'gotten up,=20
flooding our people with editions running into millions, this press=20
could not prevent the masses from becoming the sharpest enemy=20
of its own bourgeois world. The whole newspaper flood and all=20
the books that are turned out year after year by the intellectuals=20
slide off the millions of the lower classes like water from oiled=20
leather. This can prove only two things: either the unsoundness=20
of the content of this whole literary production of our bourgeois=20
world or the impossibility of reaching the heart of the broad=20
masses solely by written matter. Especially, indeed, when this=20


472=20


Mein Kampf=20


written matter demonstrates so unpsychological an attitude as=20
is here the case.=20

Let no one reply (as a big German national newspaper in=20
Berlin tried to do) that Marxism itself, by its writings, especially=20
by the effect of the great basic work of Karl Marx, provides proof=20
counter, to this assertion. Seldom has anyone made a more super=C2=AC=20
ficial attempt to support an erroneous view. What gave Marxism=20
its astonishing power over the great masses is by no means the=20
formal written work of the Jewish intellectual world, but rather=20
the enormous oratorical propaganda wave which took possession=20
of the great masses in the course of the years. Of a hundred=20
thousand German workers, not a hundred on the average know=20
this work, which has always been studied by a thousand times=20
more intellectuals and especially Jews than by real adherents of=20
this movement from the great lower classes. And this work was=20
not written for the great masses, but exclusively for the intellec-=20
tual leadership of that Jewish machine for world conquest; it=20
was stoked subsequently with an entirely different fuel: the press.=20
For that is what distinguishes the Marxist press from our bour=C2=AC=20
geois press. The Marxist press is written by agitators , and the=20
bourgeois press would like to carry on agitation by means of writers .=20
The Social Democratic yellow journalist, who almost always=20
goes from the meeting hall to the newspaper office, knows his=20
public like no one else. But the bourgeois scribbler who comes=20
out of his study to confront the great masses is nauseated by=20
their very fumes and faces them helplessly with the written word.=20

What has won the millions of workers for Marxism is less the=20
literary style of the Marxist church fathers than the indefatiga=C2=AC=20
ble and truly enormous propaganda work of tens of thousands=20
of untiring agitators, from the great agitator down to the small=20
trade-union official and the shop steward and discussion speaker;=20
this work consisted of the hundreds of thousands of meetings at=20
which, standing on the table in smoky taverns, these people=E2=80=99s=20
orators hammered at the masses and thus were able to acquire=20
a marvelous knowledge of this human material which really put=20
them in a position to choose the best weapons for attacking the=20


Requirements eor Effective Oratory 473=20

fortress of public opinion. And it consisted, furthermore, in the=20
gigantic mass demonstrations, these parades of hundreds of=20
thousands of men, which burned into the small, wretched indi=C2=AC=20
vidual the proud conviction that, paltry worm as he was, he was=20
nevertheless a part of a great dragon, 1 beneath whose burning=20
breath the hated bourgeois world would some day go up in fire=20
and flame and the proletarian dictatorship would celebrate its=20
ultimate final victory.=20

Such propaganda produced the people who were ready and=20
prepared to read a Social Democratic press, however, a press=20
which itself in turn is not written, but which is spoken. For,=20
while in the bourgeois camp professors and scholars, theoreticians=20
and writers of all sorts, occasionally attempt to speak, in the=20
Marxist movement the speakers occasionally try to write. And=20
precisely the Jew, who is especially to be considered in this con=C2=AC=20
nection, will, in general, thanks to his lying dialectical skill and=20
suppleness, even as a writer be more of an agitational orator=20
than a literary creator.=20

That is the reason why the bourgeois newspaper world (quite=20
aside from the fact that it, too, is mostly Jewified and therefore=20
has no interest in really instructing the great masses) cannot=20
exert the slightest influence on the opinion of the broadest sections=20
of our people.=20

How hard it is to upset emotional prejudices, moods, senti=C2=AC=20
ments, etc., and to replace them by others, on how many scarcely=20
calculable influences and conditions success depends, the sensi=C2=AC=20
tive speaker can judge by the fact that even the time of day in=20
which the lecture takes place can have a decisive influence on the=20
effect. The same lecture, the same speaker, the same theme, have=20
an entirely different effect at ten o=E2=80=99clock in the morning, at thre=
e=20
o=E2=80=99clock in the afternoon, or at night. I myself as a beginner=20
organized meetings for the morning, and especially remember=20
a rally which we held in the Munich Kindi Keller as a pro=C2=AC=20
test =E2=80=98against the oppression of German territories.=E2=80=99 At tha=
t=20
time it was Munich=E2=80=99s largest hall and it seemed a very great=20

11 Als kleiner Wurtn dennoch died eines grossen Drachens zu seind=20


474=20


Mein Kampf=20


venture. In order to make attendance particularly easy for the=20
adherents of the movement and all the others who came, I set=20
the meeting for a Sunday morning at ten o=E2=80=99clock. The result=20
was depressing, yet at the same time extremely instructive:=20
the hall was full, the impression really overpowering, but the=20
mood ice cold; no one became warm, and I myself as a speaker=20
felt profoundly unhappy at being unable to create any bond,=20
not even the slightest contact, between myself and my audience.=20
I thought I had not spoken worse than usual; but the effect=20
seemed to be practically nil. Utterly dissatisfied, though richer=20
by one experience, I left the meeting. Tests of the same sort=20
that I later undertook led to the same result.=20

This should surprise no one. Go to a theater performance and=20
witness a play at three o=E2=80=99clock in the afternoon and the same=20
play with the same actors at eight at night,, and you will be=20
amazed at the difference in effect and impression. A man with=20
fine feelings and the power to achieve clarity with regard to this=20
mood will be able to establish at once that the impression made=20
by the performance at three in the afternoon is not as great as=20
that made in the evening. The same applies even to a movie.=20
This is important because in the theater it might be said that=20
perhaps the actor does not take as much pains in the afternoon=20
as at night. But a film is no different in the afternoon than at=20
nine in the evening. No, the time itself exerts a definite effect,=20
just as the hall does on me. There are halls which leave people=20
cold for reasons that are hard to discern, but which somehow=20
oppose the most violent resistance to any creation of mood.=20
Traditional memories and ideas that are present in a man can=20
also decisively determine an impression. Thus, a performance of=20
Parsifal in Bayreuth will always have a different effect than=20
anywhere else in the world. The mysterious magic of the house=20
on the Festspielhiigel in the old city of the margraves cannot be=20
replaced or even compensated for by externals.=20

In all these cases we have to do with an encroachment upon=20
man=E2=80=99s freedom of will. This applies most, of course, to meetings=20
attended by people with a contrary attitude of will, who must=20


Orators and Revolution=20


475=20


now be won over to a new will. In the morning and even during=20
the day people=E2=80=99s will power seems to struggle with the greatest=20
energy against an attempt to force upon them a strange will and=20
a strange opinion. At night, however, they succumb more=20
easily to the dominating force of a stronger will. For, in truth,=20
every such meeting represents a wrestling bout between two=20
opposing forces. The superior oratorical art of a dominating=20
preacher will succeed more easily in winning to the new will=20
people who have themselves experienced a weakening of their=20
force of resistance in the most natural way than those who are=20
still in full possession of their mental tension and will.=20

The same purpose, after all, is served by the artificially made=20
and yet mysterious twilight in Catholic churches, the burning=20
lamps, incense, censers, etc.=20

In this wrestling bout of the speaker with the adversaries he=20
wants to convert, he will gradually achieve that wonderful sensi=C2=AC=20
tivity to the psychological requirements of propaganda, which the=20
writer almost always lacks. Hence the written word in its limited=20
effect will in general serve more to retain, to reinforce, to deepen,=20
a point of view or opinion that is already present. Really great=20
historical changes are not induced by the written word, but at=20
most accompanied by it.=20

Let no one believe that the French Revolution would ever have=20
come about through philosophical theories if it had not found=20
an army of agitators led by demagogues in the grand style, who=20
whipped up the passions of the people tormented to begin with,=20
until at last there occurred that terrible volcanic eruption which=20
held all Europe rigid with fear. And likewise the greatest revolu=C2=AC=20
tionary upheaval of the most recent period, the Bolshevist Revo=C2=AC=20
lution in Russia, was brought about, not by Lenin=E2=80=99s writings,=20
but by the hate-fomenting oratorical activity of countless of the=20
greatest and the smallest apostles of agitation.=20

The illiterate common people were not, forsooth, fired with=20
enthusiasm for the Communist Revolution by the theoretical=20
reading of Karl Marx, but solely by the glittering heaven which=20
thousands of agitators, themselves, to be sure, all in the service=20
of an idea, talked into the people.=20


476=20


Mein Kampf=20


And that has always been so and will eternally remain so.=20

It is entirely in keeping with the stubborn unworldliness of=20
our German intelligentsia to believe that the writer must neces=C2=AC=20
sarily be mentally superior to the speaker. This conception is=20
illustrated in the most precious way by a criticism appearing in=20
the above-mentioned national newspaper, in which it is stated=20
that one is so often disappointed to see the speech of a recognized=20
great orator suddenly in print. This reminds me of another criti=C2=AC=20
cism which came into my hands in the course of the War; it=20
painfully subjected the speeches of Lloyd George, who at that=20
time was still munitions minister, to the magnifying glass, only=20
to arrive at the brilliant discovery that these speeches were=20
scientifically inferior products and hackneyed to boot. Later, in=20
the form of a little volume, these speeches came into my own=20
hands, and I had to laugh aloud that an average German knight=20
of the ink-pot should possess no understanding for these psycho=C2=AC=20
logical masterpieces in the art of mass propaganda. This man=20
judged these speeches solely according to the impression they=20
left on his own blase nature, while the great English demagogue=20
had set out solely to exert the greatest possible effect on the=20
mass of his listeners, and in the broadest sense on the entire=20
English lower class. Regarded from this standpoint, the speeches=20
of this Englishman were the most wonderful performances, for=20
they testified to a positively amazing knowledge of the soul of the=20
broad masses of the people. And their effect was truly powerful.=20

Compare to it the helpless stammering of a Bethmann-Hollweg.=20
These speeches, to be sure, were apparently wittier, but in reality=20
they only showed this man=E2=80=99s inability to speak to his people,=20
which he simply did not know. Nevertheless, the average sparrow=20
brain of a German scribbler, equipped, it goes without saying,=20
with a high scientific education, manages to judge the intelli=C2=AC=20
gence of the English minister by the impression which a speech=20
aimed at mass effect makes on his own brain, calcified with sheer=20
science, and to compare it with that of a German statesman=20
whose brilliant chatter naturally finds more receptive soil in=20
him. Lloyd George proved that he was not only the equal in=20


Necessity of the Mass Meeting=20


477=20


genius of a Bethmann-Hollweg, but was a thousand times his=20
superior, precisely by the fact that in his speeches he found that=20
form and that expression which opened to him the heart of his=20
people and in the end made this people serve his will completely.=20
Precisely in the primitiveness of his language, the primordiality=20
of its forms of expression, and the use of easily intelligible ex=C2=AC=20
amples of the simplest sort lies the proof of the towering political=20
ability of this Englishman. For I must not measure the speech of a=20
statesman to his people by the impression which it leaves in a uni=C2=AC=20
versity professor , but by the effect it exerts on the people. And this=20
alone gives the standard for the speaker=E2=80=99s genius.=20

# # #=20

The amazing development of our movement, which only a few=20
years ago was founded out of the void and today is considered=20
worthy to be sharply persecuted by all the inner and outer ene=C2=AC=20
mies of our people, must be attributed to the constant considera=C2=AC=20
tion and application of these realizations.=20

Important as the movement=E2=80=99s literature may be, it will in our=20
present position be more important for the equal and uniform=20
training of the upper and lower leaders than for the winning of=20
the hostile masses. Only in the rarest cases will a convinced=20
Social Democrat or a fanatical Communist condescend to acquire=20
a National Socialist pamphlet, let alone a book, to read it and=20
from it gain an insight into our conception of life or to study the=20
critique of his own. Even a newspaper will be read but very=20
seldom if it does not bear the party stamp. Besides, this would=20
be of little use; for the general aspect of a single copy of a news=C2=AC=
=20
paper is so chopped up and so divided in its effect that looking=20
at it once cannot be expected to have any influence on the reader.=20
We may and must expect no one, for whom pennies count, to=20
subscribe steadily to an opposing newspaper merely from the=20
urge for objective enlightenment. Scarcely one out of ten=20
thousand will do this. Only a man who has already been won to=20


478=20


Mein Kampf=20


the movement will steadily read the party organ, and he will=20
read it as a running news service of his movement.=20

The case is quite different with the * spoken =E2=80=99 leaflet! The man=20
in the street will far sooner take it into his hands, especially if he=20
gets it for nothing, and all the more if the headlines plastically=20
treat a topic which at the moment is in everyone=E2=80=99s mouth. By a=20
more or less thorough perusal, it may be possible by such a=20
leaflet to call his attention to new viewpoints and attitudes, even=20
in fact to a new movement. But even this, in the most favorable=20
case, will provide only a slight impetus, never an accomplished=20
fact. For the leaflet, too, can only suggest or point to something,=20
and its effect will only appear in combination with a subsequent=20
more thoroughgoing instruction and enlightenment of its readers.=20
And this is and remains the mass meeting.=20

The mass meeting is also necessary for the reason that in it the=20
individual, who at first, while becoming a supporter of a young=20
movement, feels lonely and easily succumbs to the fear of being alone,=20
for the first time gets the picture of a larger community, which in=20
most people has a strengthening, encouraging effect. The same man,=20
within a company or a battalion, surrounded by all his comrades,=20
would set out on an attack with a lighter heart than if left en=C2=AC=20
tirely on his own. In the crowd he always feels somewhat shel=C2=AC=20
tered, even if a thousand reasons actually argue against it.=20

But the community of the great demonstration not only=20
strengthens the individual, it also unites and helps to create an=20
esprit de corps. The man who is exposed to grave tribulations,=20
as the first advocate of a new doctrine in his factory or workshop,=20
absolutely needs that strengthening which lies in the conviction=20
of being a member and fighter in a great comprehensive body.=20
And he obtains an impression of this body for the first time in the=20
mass demonstration. When from his little workshop or big fac=C2=AC=20
tory, in which he feels very small, he steps for the first time into=20
a mass meeting and has thousands and thousands of people of=20
the same opinions around him, when, as a seeker , 1 he is swept=20

of his previous conviction =E2=80=94 then he himself has succumbed to=20

The will, the longing, and also the power of thousands are accumu=C2=AC=20
lated in every individual. The man who enters such a meeting=20
doubting and wavering leaves it inwardly reinforced: he has=20
become a link in the community.=20

The National Socialist movement must never forget this and=20
in particular it must never let itself be influenced by those bour=C2=AC=20
geois simpletons who know everything better, but who neverthe=C2=AC=20
less have gambled away a great state including their own exist=C2=AC=20
ence and the rule of their class. Oh, yes, they are very, very=20
clever, they know everything, understand everything =E2=80=94 only one=20
thing they did not understand, how to prevent the German people=20
from falling into the arms of Marxism. In this they miserably=20
and wretchedly failed, so that their present conceit is only=20
arrogance , 1 which in the form of pride, as everyone knows, always=20
thrives on the same tree as stupidity.=20

If today these people attribute no special value to the spoken=20
word, they do so, it must be added, only because, thank the=20
Lord, they have become thoroughly convinced by now of the=20
ineffectualness of their own speechmaking.=20

The Struggle with the Red Front=20


In 1919-20 and also in 1921 I personally=20
attended bourgeois meetings. They always made the same=20
impression on me as in my youth the prescribed spoonful of=20
cod-liver oil. You=E2=80=99ve got to take it, and it=E2=80=99s supposed to =
be very=20
good, but it tastes terrible. If the German people were tied=20
together with cords and pulled forcibly into these bourgeois=20
=E2=80=98 demonstrations and the doors were locked till the end of the=20
performance and no one allowed to leave, it might lead to success=20
in a few centuries. Of course, I must frankly admit that in this=20
case I should probably lose all interest in life and would rather=20
not be a German at all. But since, thank the Lord, this cannot=20
be done, we have no need to be surprised that the healthy, un=C2=AC=20
spoiled people avoid =E2=80=98bourgeois mass meetings=E2=80=99 as the devil=
 holy=20
water.=20

I came to know them, these prophets of a bourgeois philosophy,=20
and I am really not surprised; I understand why they attribute=20
no importance to the spoken word. In those days I attended=20
meetings of the Democrats, the German Nationalists, the=20
German People=E2=80=99s Party, and also the Bavarian People=E2=80=99s Party=
=20
(Bavarian Center). What struck you at once was the homo=C2=AC=20
geneous solidity of the audience. It was almost always solely=20
party members that took part in one of these rallies. The=20
whole thing was without any discipline, more like a yawning=20


Bourgeois =E2=80=98Mass Meetings=E2=80=99 481=20

bridge club than a meeting of the people which had just been=20
through their greatest revolution.=20

The speakers did everything they could to preserve this peace=C2=AC=20
ful mood. They spoke, or rather, as a rule, they read speeches=20
in the style of a witty newspaper article or of a scientific treatise,=20
avoided all strong words, and here and there threw in some feeble=20
professorial joke, at which the honorable committee dutifully=20
began to laugh; though not loudly, provocatively, but in a dig=C2=AC=20
nified, subdued, reserved fashion.=20

And what a committee!=20

Once I saw a meeting in the Wagner-Saal in Munich; it was a=20
demonstration on the occasion of the anniversary of the Battle of=20
Nations at Leipzig. The speech was delivered or read by a dig=C2=AC=20
nified old gentleman, a professor at some university. On the=20
platform sat the committee. To the left a monocle, to the right=20
a monocle, and in between one without a monocle. All three in=20
frock coats, so that you got the impression either of a court of=20
justice planning an execution or of a solemn baptism, in any case=20
more of a religious solemnity. The so-called speech, which might=20
have cut a perfectly good figure in print, was simply terrible in=20
its effect. After only three quarters of an hour the whole meeting=20
was dozing along in a state of trance, which was interrupted=20
only by the departure of individual men and women, the clatter=C2=AC=20
ing of the waitresses, and the yawning of more and more numer=C2=AC=20
ous listeners. Three workers, who, either from curiosity or=20
because they had been commissioned to attend, were present at=20
the meeting, and behind whom I posted myself, looked at each=20
other from time to time with ill-concealed grins, and finally=20
nudged one another, whereupon they very quietly left the hall.=20
You could see that they did not want to disturb the meeting at=20
any price. And in this company it was really not necessary.=20
Finally the meeting seemed to be drawing to its end. After the=20
professor, whose voice had meanwhile grown steadily softer and=20
softer, had finished his lecture, the chairman of the meeting,=20
sitting between the two monocle-bearers, arose and roared at the=20
=E2=80=98German sisters=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98brothers=E2=80=99 present how=
 great his gratitude=20

was and how great their feelings on this order must be for the=20
unique lecture, as enjoyable as it was thorough and deeply pene=C2=AC=20
trating, which Professor X had given them, and which in the=20
truest sense of the word was an =E2=80=98 inner experience/ in fact, an=20
Achievement.=E2=80=99 It would be a profanation of this solemn hour to=20
add a discussion to these lucid remarks; therefore, speaking for=20
all those present, he would dispense with any such discussion=20
and instead bid them all rise from their seats and join in the cry:=20
=E2=80=98We are a united people of brothers/ etc. Finally, to conclude=20
the meeting he asked us all to sing the Deutschland song.=20

And then they sang, and it seemed to me that even at the=20
second verse the voices were becoming somewhat fewer and only=20
swelled mightily at the refrain, and at the third verse this im=C2=AC=20
pression grew stronger, and I believed that not all of them could=20
have been quite sure of the text.=20

But what does this matter if such a song rings to the heavens=20
in all fervor from the heart of a German National soul.=20

Thereupon the meeting scattered; that is, everyone rushed to=20
get out quickly, some to their beer, others to a cafe, and still=20
others into the fresh air.=20

Yes, indeed, out into the fresh air, at all costs out. That was=20
my own one feeling, too. And this was supposed to serve for the=20
glorification of a heroic struggle on the part of hundreds of=20
thousands of Prussians and Germans? Phooey, I say, and again=20
phooey!=20

The government, of course, may like this kind of thing. Nat=C2=AC=20

By contrast, it must be admitted, the National Socialist meet=C2=AC=20
ings were not 1 peaceful .=E2=80=99 There the waves of two outlooks=20
clashed, and they did not end with the insipid rattling off of=20
some patriotic song, but with a fanatical outburst of folkish and=20
national passion.=20

From the very beginning it was important to introduce blind=20
discipline in our meetings and absolutely to guarantee the author=C2=AC=20
ity of the committee in charge. For what we said in our speeches=20
was not the feeble bilge of a bourgeois =E2=80=98speaker/ but in content=20
and form was always suited to provoke a reply from our oppo=C2=AC=20
nents. And opponents there were in our meetings! How often=20
they came in dense crowds, individual agitators among them,=20
and all their faces reflecting the conviction: Today we=E2=80=99ll make an=
=20
end of you!=20

How often, indeed, they were led in, literally in columns, our=20
Red friends, with exact orders, poured into them in advance,=20
to smash up the whole show tonight and put an end to the whole=20
business. And how often it was touch and go, and only the ruth=C2=AC=20
less energy of our people in charge and the brutal activism of our=20
guards was able again and again to thwart the enemy=E2=80=99s purpose.=20

And they had every reason to feel provoked.=20

The red color of our posters in itself drew them to our meeting=20
halls. The run-of-the-mill bourgeoisie were horrified that we had=20
seized upon the red of the Bolsheviks, and they regarded this as=20
all very ambiguous. The German national souls kept privately=20
whispering to each other the suspicion that basically we were=20
nothing but a species of Marxism, perhaps Marxists, or rather,=20
socialists in disguise. For to this very day these scatterbrains=20
have not understood the difference between socialism and Marx=C2=AC=20
ism. Especially when they discovered that, as a matter of prin=C2=AC=20
ciple, we greeted in our meetings no 1 ladies and gentlemen =E2=80=99 but=
=20
only 1 national comrades ,=E2=80=99 and among ourselves spoke only of=20
party comrades , the Marxist spook seemed demonstrated for=20
many of our enemies. How often we shook with laughter at these=20
simple bourgeois scare-cats, at the sight of their ingenious witty=20
guessing games about our origin, our intentions, and our goal.=20


484=20


Mein Kampf=20


We chose the red color of our posters after careful and thor=C2=AC=20
ough reflection, in order to provoke the Left, to drive them to=20
indignation and lead them to attend our meetings if only to=20
break them up, in order to have some chance to speak to the=20
people.=20

It was really a treat in those years to follow the perplexity and=20
helplessness of our adversaries in their perpetually vacillating=20
tactics. First they called on their adherents to take no notice=20
of us and to avoid our meetings.=20

And on the whole this advice was followed.=20

But since in the course of time individuals came notwithstand=C2=AC=20
ing, and this number slowly but steadily increased and the im=C2=AC=20
pression made by our doctrine was obvious, the leaders gradually=20
became nervous and uneasy and became obsessed with the con=C2=AC=20
viction that they must not forever stand idly by and watch this=20
development, but must put an end to it by terror.=20

Thereupon came appeals to the =E2=80=98 class-conscious proletarians=E2=80=
=99 to=20
attend our meetings in masses and strike the representatives of=20
c monarchists, reactionary agitation=E2=80=99 with the fists of the pro=C2=
=AC=20
letariat.=20

All at once our meetings were filled with workers, three quarters=20
of an hour in advance. They were like a powder barrel that could=20
blow up at any moment, with a burning fuse already under it.=20
But it always turned out differently. The people came in as our=20
enemies, and when they left, if they were not our supporters, at=20
least they had grown thoughtful, indeed critical; they had begun=20
to examine the soundness of their own doctrine. But gradually=20
it transpired that after my speech lasting three hours adherents=20
and adversaries fused into a single enthusiastic mass. Then any=20
signal to smash up the meeting was in vain. Then the leaders=20
really began to be afraid, and they turned back to those who=20
had previously come out against this tactic and who now, with a=20
certain semblance of justification, emphasized their opinion that=20
the only correct method was to forbid the workers to attend our=20
meeting on principle.=20

Then they stopped coming, or at least there were fewer of=20


Vacillating Tactics of the Marxists 485=20

them. But after a short while the whole game began again from=20
the beginning.=20

The prohibition was not observed; more and more of the com=C2=AC=20
rades came, and again the adherents of the radical tactic were=20
victorious. Our meetings must be broken up, they decided.=20

Then, after two, three, or often eight and ten meetings it=20
turned out that to break up the meetings was easier said than=20
done, and the result of every single meeting was a crumbling=20
away of the Red fighting troops. Suddenly the other watchword=20
was back again: =E2=80=98 Proletarians , comrades! Avoid the meetings of=20
the National Socialist agitators /=E2=80=99=20

And the same, eternally vacillating tactic was found in the=20
Red press. Sometimes they tried to kill us by silence, then becom=C2=AC=20
ing convinced of the uselessness of this effort and again trying=20
the contrary. Every day we were =E2=80=98mentioned=E2=80=99 somewhere, usu=
=C2=AC=20
ally with the intent of making the absolute absurdity of our=20
whole existence clear to the workers. But after a certain time=20
the gentlemen could not help but feel that not only did this do=20
us no harm, but on the contrary benefited us, since naturally=20
many individuals could not help but ask themselves why so=20
many words were devoted to this phenomenon if it was absurd.=20
The people became curious. Then there was a sudden shift,=20
and they began for a time to treat us as humanity=E2=80=99s biggest crimi=
=C2=AC=20
nals. Article upon article, in which our criminality was explained=20
and proved again and again, and scandalous stories, even if=20
pulled out of the air from A to Z, were expected to do the rest.=20
But after a short time they seem to have convinced themselves=20
of the inefiicacy of these attacks; essentially all this only helped=20
really to concentrate the general attention upon us.=20

At that time I adopted the standpoint: It makes no difference=20
whatever whether they laugh at us or revile us, whether they=20
represent us as clowns or criminals; the main thing is that they=20
mention us, that they concern themselves with us again and=20
again, and that we gradually in the eyes of the workers them=C2=AC=20
selves appear to be the only power that anyone reckons with at=20
the moment. What we really are and what we really want, we=20


486=20


Mein Kampf=20


will show the wolves of the Jewish press when the time comes.=20

One more reason why, as a rule, our meetings were not directly=20
broken up in those days was the absolutely incredible cowardice=20
of the leaders of our adversaries. In all critical cases they sent=20
little rank-and-filers ahead, at most waiting outside for the=20
results of the disturbances.=20

We were almost always very well informed with regard to the=20
intentions of these gentry. Not only because, for reasons of ex=C2=AC=20
pediency, we had left many party comrades within the Red=20
formations, but because the Red wirepullers themselves were=20
afflicted with a talkativeness which in this case was very useful=20
to us, and which, unfortunately, is very frequently found among=20
the German people in general. They couldn=E2=80=99t keep it to them=C2=AC=
=20
selves when they had hatched out such a plan, and as a rule they=20
began to cackle even before the egg was laid. And so; many and=20
many a time, we had made the most comprehensive preparations=20
and the Red shock troops hadn=E2=80=99t so much as a suspicion how=20
close they were to being thrown out.=20

The times compelled us to take the defense of our meetings=20
into our own hands; one can never count on protection on the=20
part of the authorities; on the contrary, experience shows that=20
it always and exclusively benefits the disturbers. For the sole=20
actual result of intervention by the authorities =E2=80=94 that is, the=20
police =E2=80=94 was at best to dissolve, in other words, to close the=20
meeting. And that was the sole aim and purpose of the hostile=20
disturbers.=20

In this connection the police has developed a practice which=20
represents the most monstrous form of injustice that can be=20
conceived of. If through some sort of threats it becomes known=20
to the authorities that there is danger of a meeting being broken=20
up, they do not arrest the threateners, but forbid the others, the=20
innocent, to hold the meeting, and what is more, the run-of-the-=20
mill police mind is mighty proud of such wisdom. They call this=20
a *precautionary measure for the prevention of an illegal act.=E2=80=99=20

Thus, the determined gangster is always in a position to make=20
political activity and efforts impossible for decent people. In the=20


Psychological Management oe Meetings 487=20

name of law and order, the state authority gives in to the gangster=20
and requests the others please not to provoke him. And so if=20
National Socialists wanted to hold meetings in certain places=20
and the unions declared that this would lead to resistance on=20
the part of their members, the police, you may rest assured, did=20
not put these blackmailing scoundrels behind the bars, but=20
forbade our meeting. Yes, these organs of the law even had the=20
incredible shamelessness to inform us of this innumerable times=20
in writing.=20

If we wanted to defend ourselves against such eventualities, we=20
had, therefore, to make sure that any attempt at a disturbance=20
was forestalled 1 in the bud.=20

In this connection the following had also to be considered: Any=20
meeting which is protected exclusively by the police discredits its=20
organizers in the eyes of the broad masses. Meetings which are=20
guaranteed only by the presence of a large police force do not=20
attract support, since the presupposition for winning the lower=20
strata of a people is always a strength that is visibly present.=20

Just as a courageous man can more easily conquer women=E2=80=99s=20
hearts than a coward, a heroic movement will sooner win the=20
heart of a people than a cowardly one which is kept alive only=20
by police protection.=20

Especially for this last reason, the young party had to make=20
sure of defending its own existence, of protecting itself and of=20
breaking the enemy terror with its own hands.=20

The protection of meetings was based:=20

(1) On an energetic and psychologically sound conduct of the=20
meeting , 2=20

If we National Socialists held a meeting in those days, we were=20
its masters and no one else. And every minute, uninterruptedly,=20
we sharply emphasized this master right. Our opponents knew=20
perfectly well that anyone creating a provocation would be=20
mercilessly thrown out, even if we were only a dozen among half=20

a thousand. In the meetings of those days, especially outside of=20
Munich, there would be five, six, seven, and eight hundred ad=C2=AC=20
versaries to fifteen or sixteen National Socialists. But neverthe=C2=AC=20
less we tolerated no provocation, and those who attended our=20
meetings knew full well that we would rather have let ourselves=20
be beaten to death than capitulate. And it happened more than=20
once that a handful of party comrades heroically fought their=20
way to victory against a roaring, flailing Red majority.=20

In such cases these fifteen or twenty men would in the end=20
have assuredly been overcome. But the others knew that previ=C2=AC=20
ously at least twice or three times as many of them would have=20
had their skulls bashed in, and this they did not gladly risk.=20

Here we tried to learn from the study of Marxist and bourgeois=20
meeting technique, and learn we did.=20

The Marxists had always had a blind discipline, so that the=20
idea cl breaking up a Marxist meeting, by the bourgeoisie at=20
least, could not even arise. But the Reds busied themselves all=20
the more with such intentions. Gradually they had not only=20
achieved a certain virtuosity in this field, but ultimately in large=20
sections of the Reich they went so far as to designate a non-=20
Marxist meeting as such as a provocation of the proletariat;=20
especially when the wirepullers sensed that the meeting might=20
draw up the catalogue of their own sins and unmask the treach=C2=AC=20
ery with which they deceived and lied to the people. Then, as=20
soon as such a meeting was announced, the whole Red press=20
raised a furious outcry, and these men who in principle despised=20
the law were not seldom the first to turn to the authorities, with=20
the urgent and threatening request that this =E2=80=98 provocation of the=
=20
proletariat=E2=80=99 be prohibited at once, =E2=80=98in order to prevent wo=
rse=20
things from happening.=E2=80=99 They chose their language and achieved=20
their success according to the dimensions of the official bonehead.=20
But if, in an exceptional case, there was a real German official in=20
such a post, not an official toady, and he rejected the shameless=20
imposition, there followed the well-known summons not to=20
suffer such a =E2=80=98provocation of the proletariat / but on such and suc=

Bourgeois Meeting Technique=20


489=20


disgraceful activity of the bourgeois creatures, with the horny=20
fist of the proletariat/=20

You need to have seen such a bourgeois meeting, you need to=20
have seen its leaders in all their miserable fear! Often, upon=20
such threats, a meeting was simply called off. And always the=20
fear was so great that instead of eight o=E2=80=99clock the meeting was=20
seldom opened before a quarter to nine or nine o=E2=80=99clock. The=20
chairman then endeavored, with twenty-nine compliments, to=20
make it clear to the =E2=80=98gentlemen of the opposition=E2=80=99 present,=
 how=20
pleased he and all the others present were at heart (a plain lie!)=20
with the visit of men who did not yet stand on the same ground,=20
because after all only mutual discussion (to which he thereby=20
most solemnly consented in advance) could bring them closer,=20
arouse mutual understanding, and throw a bridge between them.=20
And in passing he gave assurance that it was by no means the=20
purpose of the meeting to turn people away from their previous=20
views. No, indeed, let each man be happy in his own fashion,=20
but let him not interfere with the happiness of others; and so he=20
requested the audience to let the speaker complete his remarks,=20
which would not be very long anyway, so that this meeting=20
should not present to the world the shameful spectacle of German=20
brothers quarreling among themselves... Brrr!=20

But the brethren on the Left usually had no understanding for=20
this; no, before the speaker had even begun, he had to pack up=20
his things amid the wildest abuse; and not seldom you got the=20
impression that he was thankful to Fate for quickly cutting off=20
the painful procedure. Amid a monstrous tumult such bourgeois=20
meeting-hall toreadors left the arena, except when they flew down=20
the steps with gashed heads, which was actually often the case.=20

And so, you may be sure, it was something new to the Marxists=20
when we National Socialists organized our first meetings, and=20
especially how we organized them. They came in convinced that,=20
of course, they would be able to repeat on us the little game they=20
had so often played. =E2=80=98Today we=E2=80=99ll finish you off!=E2=80=99 =
How many a=20
one boastfully shouted this sentence to another on entering our=20
meeting, only to find himself outside the hall in the twinkling=20


490=20


Mein Kampf=20


of an eye, even before he could shout his second interruption.=20

In the first place, the committee in charge was different with=20
us. No one begged the audience graciously to permit our speech,=20
nor was everyone guaranteed unlimited time for discussion; it=20
was simply stated that we were the masters of the meeting, that=20
in consequence we had the privilege of the house, and that any=C2=AC=20
one who should dare to utter so much as a single cry of interrup=C2=AC=20
tion would be mercilessly thrown out where he came from. That,=20
furthermore, we must reject any responsibility for such a fellow;=20
if there was time left and it suited us, we would permit a dis=C2=AC=20
cussion to take place, if not, there would be none, and the speaker,=20
Party Comrade So-and-So, had the floor.=20

This in itself filled them with amazement.=20

In the second place, we disposed of a rigidly organized house=20
guard. In the bourgeois parties this house guard, or rather=20
monitor service, usually consisted of gentlemen who believed=20
that the dignity of their years gave them a certain claim to=20
authority and respect. But since the Marxist-incited masses did=20
not have the least regard for age, authority, and respect, the=20
existence of this bourgeois house guard was for practical purposes=20
nullified, so to speak.=20

At the very beginning of our big meetings, I began the organ=C2=AC=20
ization of a house guard in the form of a monitor service , which as=20
a matter of principle included only young fellows. These were in=20
part comrades whom I knew from military service; others were=20
newly won party comrades who from the very outset were in=C2=AC=20
structed and trained in the viewpoint that terror can only be=20
broken by terror; that on this earth success has always gone to=20
the courageous, determined man; that we are fighting for a=20
mighty idea, so great and noble that it well deserves to be=20
guarded and protected with the last drop of blood. They were=20
imbued with the doctrine that, as long as reason was silent and=20
violence had the last word, the best weapon of defense lay in=20
attack; and that our monitor troop must be preceded by the=20
reputation of not being a debating club, but a combat group=20
determined to go to any length.=20


National Socialist Monitor Troop=20


491=20


And how this youth had longed for such a slogan!=20

How disillusioned and outraged was this front-line generation,=20
how full of disgust and revulsion at bourgeois cowardice and=20
shilly-shallying!=20

Thus, it became fully clear that the revolution had been pos=C2=AC=20
sible thanks only to the disastrous bourgeois leadership of our=20
people. The fists to protect the German people would have been=20
available even then, but the heads to play the game were lacking.=20
How many a time the eyes of my lads glittered when I explained=20
to them the necessity of their mission and assured them over=20
and over again that all the wisdom on this earth remains with=C2=AC=20
out success if force does not enter into its service, guarding it=20
and protecting it; that the gentle Goddess of Peace can walk=20
only by the side of the God of War; and that every great deed=20
of this peace requires the protection and aid of force. How much=20
more vividly the idea of military service now dawned on them!=20
Not in the calcified sense of old, ossified officials serving the dead=20
authority of a dead state, but in the living consciousness of the=20
duty to fight for the existence of our people as a whole by sacri=C2=AC=20
ficing the life of the individual, always and forever, at all times=20
and places.=20

And how these lads did fight!=20

Like a swarm of hornets they swooped down on the disturbers=20
of our meetings, without regard for their superior power, no=20
matter how great it might be, without regard for wounds and=20
bloody victims, filled entirely with the one great thought of=20
creating a free path for the holy mission of our movement.=20

As early as midsummer, 1920. the organization of the monitor=20
troop gradually assumed definite forms, and in the spring of=20
1921 little by little divided into hundreds, which themselves in=20
turn were split up into groups.=20

And this was urgently necessary, for in the meanwhile our=20
public meeting activity had steadily increased. Even now, to be=20
sure, we still often met in the Festsaal of the. Munich Hofbrau-=20
haus, but even more often in the larger halls of the city. The=20
Festsaal of the Biirgerbrau and the Miinchener Kindl-Keller=20


492=20


Mein Kampf=20


saw mightier and mightier mass meetings in the fall and winter=20
of 1920-21, and the picture was always the same: rallies of the=20
NSDAP even then usually had to he closed by the police even before=20
beginning because of overcrowding .=20

w v? W=20

The organization of our monitor troop clarified a very im=C2=AC=20
portant question. Up till then the movement possessed no party=20
insignia and no party flag.. The absence of such symbols not=20
only had momentary disadvantages, but was intolerable for the=20
future. The disadvantages consisted above all in the fact that=20
the party comrades lacked any outward sign of their common=20
bond, while it was unbearable for the future to dispense with a=20
sign which possessed the character of a symbol of the movement=20
and could as such be opposed to the International.=20

What importance must be attributed to such a symbol from=20
the psychological point of view I had even in my youth more=20
than one occasion to recognize and also emotionally to under=C2=AC=20
stand. Then, after the War, I experienced a mass demonstration=20
of the Marxists in front of the Royal Palace and the Lustgarten.=20
A sea of red flags, red scarves, and red flowers gave to this demon=C2=AC=
=20
stration, in which an estimated hundred and twenty thousand=20
persons took part, an aspect that was gigantic from the purely=20
external point of view. I myself could feel and understand how=20
easil) r the man of the people succumbs to the suggestive magic of=20
a spectacle so grandiose in effect.=20

The bourgeoisie, which in its party politics neither represents=20
nor advocates any outlook at all, had therefore no flag of its own.=20
They consisted of =E2=80=98patriots=E2=80=99 and therefore ran around in th=
e=20
colors of the Reich. If these had been the symbol of a definite=20
philosophy, it would have been understandable that the owners=20
of the state viewed its flag as the representative of its philosophy,=20
since the symbol of their philosophy had become the flag of the=20
state and the Reich through their own activity.=20


The Old Banner and the New=20


493=20


But this was not the case.=20

The Reich had been formed without any move on the part of=20
the German bourgeoisie, and the flag itself had been born from=20
the womb of war. Hence it was really nothing but a state flag=20
and possessed no meaning of any sort in the sense of a special=20
philosophical mission.=20

Only in one spot of the German language area was anything=20
like a bourgeois party flag in existence =E2=80=94 in German Austria.=20
By choosing the colors of 1848, black, red, and gold, for its party=20
symbol, a part of the national bourgeoisie in that country had=20
created a symbol, which, though without any meaning in a phil=C2=AC=20
osophical sense, nevertheless had a revolutionary character,=20
politically speaking. The sharpest enemies of this black , red, and=20
gold flag were then =E2=80=94 and today this should not be forgotten =E2=80=
=94=20
the Social Democrats and the Christian Social Party , or Clericals .=20
It was precisely they who in those days reviled, befouled, and=20
soiled these colors, just as later, in 1918, they dragged the black,=20
white, and red into the gutter. At all events, the black, red, and=20
gold of the German parties of old Austria were the colors of 1848;=20
that is, of a time which may have been fantastic, but which was=20
represented by the most honorable individual German souls,=20
though the Jew stood in the background as the invisible wire=C2=AC=20
puller. Therefore, it was high treason and the shameless selling-=20
out of the German people and German treasure which made=20
these flags so agreeable to the Marxists and the Center that=20
today they honor them as their most sacred possession and create=20
organizations of their own for the protection of the flag they once=20
spat upon.=20

And so, up to 1920, Marxism was actually confronted by no=20
flag which philosophically would have represented its polar=20
opposite. For even if the best parties of the German bourgeoisie=20
after 1918 would no longer consent to take over the suddenly=20
discovered black, red, and gold flag as their own symbol, they=20
themselves had no program of their own for the future to oppose=20
to the new development; at best they had the idea of a recon=C2=AC=20
struction of the pa c t Peicb=20


494=20


Mein Kampf=20


And it is to this idea that the black, white, and red banner=20
of the old Reich owes its resurrection as the flag of our so-called=20
national bourgeois parties.=20

It is obvious that the symbol of a state of affairs, which could=20
be overcome by Marxism under conditions and attendant circum=C2=AC=20
stances that were anything but glorious, is ill-suited for a symbol=20
under which to annihilate this same Marxism. Sacred and beloved=20
as these old and uniquely beautiful colors, in their fresh, youthful=20
combination, must be to every decent German who has fought under=20
them and beheld the sacrifice of so many, the flag is worthless as a=20
symbol for a struggle for the future.=20

Unlike the bourgeois politicians, I have, in our movement,=20
always upheld the standpoint that it is a true good fortune for=20
the German nation to have lost the old flag. What the Republic=20
does beneath its flag, can remain indifferent to us. But from the=20
bottom of our hearts we should thank Fate for having been=20
gracious enough to preserve the most glorious war flag of all=20
times from being used as a bedsheet for the most shameful prosti=C2=AC=20
tution. The present-day Reich, which sells itself and its citizens,=20
must never be permitted to fly the black, white, and red flag of=20
honor and heroes.=20

As long as the November disgrace endures, let it bear its=20
own outer covering and not try to steal this like everything else=20
from a more honorable past. Let our bourgeois politicians remind=20
their conscience that anyone who desires the black, white, and=20
red flag for this state is burglarizing our past. Truly, the former=20
flag was suited only to the former Reich, just as, God be praised=20
and thanked, the Republic chose the one suited to it.=20

This was also the reason why we National Socialists could have=20
seen no expressive symbol of our own activity in hoisting the old=20
flag. For we do not desire to awaken from death the old Reich=20
that perished through its own errors, but to build a new state.=20

The movement which today fights Marxism with this aim must=20
therefore bear the symbol of the new state in its very flag.=20

The question of the new flag =E2=80=94 that is, its appearance =E2=80=94 oc=
cu=C2=AC=20
pied us intensely in those days. From all sides came suggestions,=20


The National Socialist Flag=20


495=20


which for the most part it must be admitted were more well-=20
intended txian successful. For the new flag had to be equally a=20
symbol of our own struggle, since on the other hand it was ex=C2=AC=20
pected also to be highly effective as a poster. Anyone who has=20
to concern himself much with the masses will recognize these=20
apparent trifles to be very important matters. An effective=20
insignia can in hundreds of thousands of cases give the first=20
impetus toward interest in a movement.=20

For this reason we had to reject all suggestions of identifying=20
our movement through a white flag with the old state, or, more=20
correctly, with those feeble parties whose sole political aim was=20
the restoration of past conditions, as was proposed by many=20
quarters. Besides, white is not a stirring color. It is suitable for=20
chaste virgins=E2=80=99 clubs, but not for world-changing movements in a.=
=20
revolutionary epoch.=20

Black was also suggested: in itself suitable for the present=20
period, it contained nothing, however, that could in any way=20
be interpreted as a picture of the will of our movement. Finally,=20
this color has not a stirring enough effect either.=20

White and blue were out of the question despite their wonder=C2=AC=20
ful esthetic effect, for these were the colors of an individual=20
German state, and of an orientation toward particularistic=20
narrow-mindedness which unfortunately did not enjoy the best=20
reputation. Here, too, moreover, it would have been hard to=20
find any reference to our movement. The same applied to black=20
and white.=20

Black, red, and gold were in themselves out of the question.=20

So were black, white, and red, for reasons already mentioned,=20
at least in their previous composition. In effect, to be sure, this=20
color combination stands high above all others. It is the most=20
brilliant harmony in existence.=20

I myself always came out for the retention of the old colors,=20
not only because as a soldier they are to me the holiest thing I=20
know, but because also in their esthetic effect they are by far the=20
most compatible with my feeling. Nevertheless, I was obliged to=20
reject without exception the numerous designs which poured in=20


496=20


Mein Kampf=20


from the circles of the young movement, and which for the most=20
part had drawn the swastika into the old flag. I myself =E2=80=94 as=20
Leader =E2=80=94 did not want to come out publicly at once with my own=20
design, since after all it was possible that another should produce=20
one just as good or perhaps even better. Actually, a dentist from=20
Starnberg did deliver a design that was not bad at all, and, in=C2=AC=20
cidentally, was quite close to my own, having only the one fault=20
that a swastika with curved legs was composed into a white disk.=20

I myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid=20
down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and=20
a black swastika in the middle. After long trials I also found a=20
definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the=20
white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the swastika.=20

And this remained final.=20

Along the same lines arm-bands were immediately ordered for=20
the monitor detachments, a red band, likewise with the white disk=20
and black swastika.=20

The party insignia was also designed along the same lines: a=20
white disk on a red field, with the swastika in the middle. A=20
Munich goldsmith by the name of Ftiss furnished the first usable=20
design, which was kept.=20

In midsummer of 1920 the new flag came before the public for=20
the first time. It was excellently suited to our new movement. It=20
was young and new, like the movement itself. No one had seen it=20
before; it had the effect of a burning torch. We ourselves experi=C2=AC=20
enced an almost childlike joy when a faithful woman party com=C2=AC=20
rade for the first time executed the design and delivered the flag.=20
Only a few months later we had half a dozen of them in Munich,=20
and the monitor troop, which was growing bigger and bigger,=20
especially contributed to spreading the new symbol of the move=C2=AC=20
ment.=20

And a symbol it really is! Not only that the unique colors,=20
which all of us so passionately love and which once won so much=20
honor for the German people, attest our veneration for the past;=20
they were also the best embodiment of the movement=E2=80=99s will. As=20
National Socialists, we see our program in our flag. In red we see=20


The National Socialist Symbol=20


497=20


the social idea of the movement, in white the nationalistic idea, in=20
the swastika the mission of the struggle for the victory of the=20
Aryan man, and, by the same token, the victory of the idea of=20
creative work, which as such always has been and always will be=20
anti-Semitic.=20

Two years later, when the monitor troop had long since become=20
a Sturm--Abteilung (storm section), embracing many thousands of=20
men, it seemed necessary to give this armed organization a special=20
symbol of victory: the standard. This, too, I designed myself and=20
then gave it to a loyal old party comrade, master goldsmith Gahr,=20
for execution. Since then the standard is among the symbols and=20
battle signs of the National Socialist struggle.=20


w w tt=20

Our public meeting activity, which increased more and more in=20
1920, finally led to the point where we held as many as two meet=C2=AC=20
ings in some weeks. People crowded in front of our posters, the=20
largest halls of the city were always filled, and tens of thousands=20
of misled Marxists found the way back to their national commu=C2=AC=20
nity to become warriors for a free German Reich to come. The=20
Munich public had come to know us. People spoke of us, the=20
word =E2=80=98National Socialist 3 became familiar to many and already=20
meant a program. The host of adherents, and even of members,=20
began to grow uninterruptedly, so that in the winter of 1920-21=20
we could already be regarded as a strong party in Munich.=20

Aside from the Marxist parties there was in those days no=20
party, above all no national party, which could boast of such mass=20
demonstrations as ours. The Miinchener-Kindl-Keller, holding=20
five thousand people, had more than once been filled to the burst=C2=AC=20
ing point, and there was only a single hall into which we had not=20
yet ventured, and this was the Zirkus Krone.=20

At the end of January, 1921, grave cares arose once more for=20
Germany. The Paris Agreement, according to which Germany=20
obligated herself to pay the insane sum of a hundred billion gold=20


498=20


Mein Kampf=20


marks, was to be realized in the form of the London dictate. 1=20

A working federation of so-called folkish leagues , long existing in=20
Munich, wanted to call a large common protest meeting on this=20
occasion. Time was pressing, and I myself was nervous in view of=20
the eternal hesitation and delay in carrying out decisions that=20
had been taken. First there was talk of a demonstration on the=20
Konigsplatz, but this was abandoned for fear of being broken up=20
by the Reds and a protest demonstration in front of the Feldherrn-=20
halle was projected. But this too was abandoned and finally a=20
common demonstration in the Munchener-Kindl-Keller was sug=C2=AC=20
gested. Meanwhile, day after day had passed, the big parties had=20
taken no notice whatever of the great event, and the action com=C2=AC=20
mittee could not make up its mind to set a definite date for the=20
intended demonstration.=20

On Tuesday, February 1, 1921,1 most urgently demanded a=20
final decision. I was put off till Wednesday. So on Wednesday I=20
absolutely insisted on clear information when and whether the=20
demonstration should take place. The answer was again in=C2=AC=20
definite and evasive; I was told that they =E2=80=98intended=E2=80=99 to ca=
ll a=20
demonstration for Wednesday a week.=20

With this the cord of my patience snapped and I decided to=20
carry through the protest demonstration alone. On Wednesday=20
noon I dictated the poster into the typewriter in ten minutes and=20
at the same time had the Zirkus Krone rented for the following=20
day, Thursday, February 3.=20

At that time this was a tremendous venture. Not only that it=20
seemed questionable whether we could fill the gigantic hall, but=20
we also ran the danger of being broken up.=20

Our monitor troop was far from being adequate for this colossal=20

1 The Supreme Allied Council met in Paris from January 24 to 30, and=20
elaborated a plan of reparations payments. Annual payments were to begin=20
at two billion gold marks a year and gradually increase to six billions at =
the=20
end of eleven years.=20

The London Conference on Reparations, held from April 29 to May 5=20
of the same year, sent an ultimatum to Germany demanding one billion gold=
=20
marks on penalty of occupying the Ruhr. The Germans accepted the terms=20
and paid the sum by borrowing in London.=20


The First Meeting in the Circus=20


499=20


hall. And I had no proper idea about the kind of procedure pos=C2=AC=20
sible in case of an attempt to break the meeting up. At that time=20
^thought this would be much harder for us in the Circus building=20
than in a normal hall. Yet, as it later turned out, the truth was=20
exactly the opposite. Actually, in this gigantic hall, it was easier=20
to master a troop of disturbers than in small halls where you were=20
penned in.=20

Only one thing was certain: any failure could throw us back for=20
a long time to come. For if we were once successfully broken up, it=20
would have destroyed our nimbus at one stroke and encouraged=20
our opponents to attempt again what had once succeeded. This=20
could have led to a sabotage of our whole further meeting activity,=20
which would have taken many months and the hardest struggles=20
to overcome.=20

We had only one day=E2=80=99s time to put up posters, that was Thurs=C2=AC=
=20
day itself. Unfortunately, it was raining in the morning, and the=20
fear seemed founded that under such circumstances many people=20
would prefer to stay home, instead of hurrying through the rain=20
and snow to a meeting at which there might possibly be murder=20
and homicide.=20

Altogether, I suddenly became afraid on Thursday morning=20
that the hall would not be filled after all (and in this case I would=20
have been discredited in the eyes of the working federation), so=20
now I hastily dictated a few leaflets and had them printed for=20
circulation in the afternoon. They naturally contained an appeal=20
to attend the meeting.=20

Two trucks that I had hired were swathed in as much red as=20
possible, a few of our flags were planted on top of them and each=20
one was manned with fifteen to twenty party comrades; they re=C2=AC=20
ceived the command to drive conscientiously through the streets=20
of the city and throw off leaflets; in short, to make propaganda=20
for the mass demonstration in the evening. It was the first time=20
that trucks had driven through the city with banners and no=20
Marxists on them. Consequently the bourgeoisie stared open-=20
mouthed after the red car decked out with fluttering swastika=20
flags, while in the outer sections numerous clenched fists arose=20


500=20


Mein Kampf=20


whose owners seemed obviously burned up with rage at this=20
newest =E2=80=98 provocation of the proletariat/ For only the Marxists=20
had the right to hold meetings or to drive around in trucks.=20

At seven that night the Circus was not yet well filled. Every=20
ten minutes I was notified by phone, and even I was pretty wor=C2=AC=20
ried; for at seven or a quarter after, the other halls had usually=20
been half, in fact, often almost entirely, full. This, however, was=20
soon explained. I had not reckoned with the gigantic dimensions=20
of the new hall: a thousand persons made the Hof brauhaus seem=20
very well filled, while they were simply swallowed up by the=20
Zirkus Krone. You could hardly see them. A short time later,=20
however, more favorable reports came in, and at a quarter to=20
eight word came that the hall was three-quarters full and that=20
large crowds were standing outside the box office windows.=20
Thereupon I set out.=20

At two minutes past eight I arrived in front of the Circus.=20
There was still a crowd to be seen in front, partly just curious=20
people, with many opponents among them who wanted to stay=20
outside and see what would happen.=20

As I entered the mighty hall, the same joy seized me as a year=20
previous in the first meeting at the Munich Hof brauhaus Fest-=20
saal. But only after I had pressed my way through the human=20
walls and reached the lofty platform did I see the success in all=20
its magnitude. Like a giant shell this hall lay before me, filled=20
with thousands and thousands of people. Even the ring was=20
black with people. Over five thousand six hundred tickets had=20
been sold, and if we included the total number of unemployed, of=20
poor students and our monitor detachments, there must have been=20
six and a half thousand persons.=20

=E2=80=98Future or Ruin=E2=80=99 was the theme, and my heart rejoiced in th=
e=20
conviction that down there before me the future lay.=20

I began to speak, and spoke about two and a half hours; and=20
my feeling told me after the first half hour that the meeting would=20
be a great success. Contact with all these thousands of individuals=20
had been established. After the first hour the applause began to=20
interrupt me in greater and greater spontaneous outbursts, ebbing=20


Meeting Upon Meeting=20


501=20


off after two hours into that solemn stillness which I have later=20
experienced so very often in this hall, and which will remain un=C2=AC=20
forgettable to every single member of the audience. Then you=20
could hardly hear more than the breathing of this gigantic mul=C2=AC=20
titude, and only when the last word had been spoken did the ap=C2=AC=20
plause suddenly roar forth to find its release and conclusion in the=20
Deutschland song, sung with the highest fervor.=20

I stayed to watch as the giant hall slowly began to empty and=20
for nearly twenty minutes an enormous sea of human beings=20
forced its way through the mighty center exit. Only then did I=20
myself, overjoyed, leave my place to go home.=20

Photographs were made of this first meeting in the Zirkus=20
Krone. They show better than words the magnitude of the=20
demonstration. Bourgeois papers ran pictures and notices, but=20
they only mentioned that there had been a National=E2=80=99 demonstra=C2=AC=
=20
tion and with their usual modesty passed over the organizers in=20
silence.=20

With this we had for the first time far overstepped the bounds=20
of an ordinary party of the day. We could no longer be ignored.=20
And now, lest the impression arise that this successful meeting=20
was nothing more than fly-by-night, I immediately fixed a second=20
meeting in the Circus for the coming week, and the success was=20
the same. Again the gigantic hall was full to the bursting point=20
with human masses, so that I decided to hold a meeting in the=20
coming week in the same style for the third time. And for the=20
third time the giant Circus was packed full of people from top to=20
bottom.=20

After this introduction to the year 1921,1 increased our public=20
meeting activity in Munich even more. I now switched over to=20
holding not only one meeting every week, but in some weeks two=20
mass meetings; in fact, in midsummer and late fall, it was some=C2=AC=20
times three. We still met in the Circus and to our satisfaction=20
noted that all our evenings brought the same success.=20

The result was a steadily increasing number of adherents to the=20
movement and a great increase in members.=20


502=20


Mein Kampe=20


Such successes naturally did not leave our enemies inactive.=20
Always wavering in their tactics, they had alternated between a=20
policy of terror and one of killing us by silence, and now, as they=20
themselves were forced to recognize, they could in no way obstruct=20
the development of the movement with either the one or the=20
other. And so, with a last exertion, they decided upon an act of=20
terror that would definitely bar any further public meeting activ-=20
ity on our part.=20

As outward occasion for this action they used a highly mysteri=C2=AC=20
ous attack upon a deputy in the Bavarian Diet by the name of=20
Erhard Auer. 1 The said Erhard Auer was said to have been shot=20
at one night by someone. That is, he had not actually been shot,=20
but an attempt had been made to shoot him. Amazing presence of=20
mind, as well as the proverbial courage of the Social Democratic=20
Party leader, had ostensibly not only frustrated the- insidious at=C2=AC=20
tack, but put the infamous assailants to ignominious flight.=20
They had fled so hastily and so far that even later the police=20
could not catch the slightest trace 2 of them. This mysterious=20
occurrence was now used by the organ of the Social Democratic=20
Party in Munich to agitate against the movement in the most=20
unrestrained fashion, and among other things to hint with their=20
customary loose tongue at what must soon follow. Measures had=20
been taken, they hinted, to keep us from getting out of hand;=20
proletarian fists would intervene before it was too late.=20

And a few days later the day of intervention was at hand.=20

A meeting in the Munich Hofbrauhaus Festsaal, at which=20
I myself was to speak, had been chosen for the final reckon=C2=AC=20
ing.=20

On November 4, 1921, between six and seven in the evening, I=20
received the first positive news that the meeting would definitely=20


1 Erhard Auer was leader of the Munich Social Democrats and a member of=20
the Bavarian Diet. Hitler=E2=80=99s story is accurate to the extent that Au=
er himself=20
reported the attempt to murder him and that nothing was ever learned of his=
=20
assailants.=20

2 =E2=80=98 nicht die leiseste Spur erwischen=20



An Attempted Disruption=20


503=20


be broken up, and that for this purpose they intended to=20
send in great masses of workers, especially from a few Red=20
factories.=20

It must be laid to an unfortunate accident that we did not get=20
this information earlier. On the same day we had given up our=20
venerable old business office in the Sterneckergasse in Munich=20
and had moved to a new one; that is, we were out of the old one,=20
but could not yet move into the new one because work was still=20
going on inside. Since the telephone had already been taken out=20
of the old one and not yet installed in the new one, a number of=20
attempts to inform us by telephone of the intended invasion had=20
been in vain.=20

The consequence of this was that the meeting itself was pro=C2=AC=20
tected only by extremely weak monitor groups. Only a numeri=C2=AC=20
cally weak company, comprising about forty-six heads, 1 was pres=C2=AC=20
ent, and the alarm apparatus was not yet sufficiently developed to=20
bring ample reinforcement in the space of an hour in the evening.=20
Added to this was the fact that such alarmist rumors had come to=20
our ears innumerable times without anything special happen=C2=AC=20
ing. The old saying that announced revolutions usually fail to=20
take place had up to this time always proved correct in our=20
experience.=20

And so, for this reason, too, perhaps everything was not done=20
which could have been done that day, to counter any attempt to=20
break up the meeting with the most brutal determination.=20

Finally, we regarded the Festsaal of the Munich Hofbrauhaus=20
as most unsuited for an attempt to break up a meeting. We had=20
been more afraid for the largest halls, especially the Circus. In=20
this connection this day gave us a valuable lesson. Later we=20
studied all these questions with a method which I should call=20
truly scientific and came to results which in part were as incred=C2=AC=20
ible as they were interesting and in the ensuing period were of=20

1 The German word I have translated as =E2=80=98company 1 is l Hundertschaf=
t,'=20
literally a company of one hundred. The effect in German is somewhat=20
ludicrous, but not impossible, as it would be in English to say =E2=80=98a =

comprising about forty-six heads.=E2=80=99=20


504=20


Mein Kampf=20


basic importance for the organizational and tactical leadership of=20
our storm troops.=20

When I entered the vestibule of the Hofbrauhaus at a quarter of=20
eight, there could indeed be no doubt with regard to the existing=20
intention. The room was overcrowded and had therefore been=20
closed by the police. Our enemies who had appeared very early=20
were for the most part in the hall, and our supporters for the=20
most part outside. The small S.A. awaited me in the vestibule. I=20
had the doors to the large hall closed and then ordered the forty-=20
five or forty-six men to line up. I made it clear to the lads that=20
today probably for the first time they would have to show them=C2=AC=20
selves loyal to the movement through thick and thin, and that not=20
a man of us must leave the hall unless we were carried out dead; I=20
myself would remain in the hall, and I did not believe that a single=20
one of them would desert me; but if I should see anyone playing=20
the coward, I myself would personally tear off his arm-band and=20
take away his insignia. Then I called upon them to advance im=C2=AC=20
mediately at the slightest attempt to break up the meeting, and=20
to bear in mind that the best defense lies in your own offensive.=20

The answer was a threefold Heil that sounded rougher and=20
hoarser than usual.=20

Then I went into the hall and surveyed the situation with my=20
own eyes. They were sitting in there, tight-packed, and tried to=20
stab me with their very eyes. Innumerable faces were turned=20
toward me with sullen hatred, while again others, with mocking=20
grimaces, let out cries capable of no two interpretations. Today=20
they would =E2=80=98make an end of us/ wo should look out for our guts,=20
they would stop our mouths for good, and all the rest of these=20
lovely phrases. They were conscious of their superior power and=20
felt accordingly.=20

Nevertheless, the meeting could be opened and I began to=20
speak. In the Festsaal of the Hofbrauhaus I always stood on one=20
of the long sides of the hall and my platform was a beer table.=20
And so I was actually in the midst of the people. Perhaps this=20
circumstance contributed to creating in this hall a mood such as I=20
have never found anywhere else.=20




An Attempted Disruption=20


505=20


In front of me, especially to the left of me, only enemies were=20
sitting and standing. They were all robust men and young fellows,=20
in large part from the Maffei factory, from Kustermann=E2=80=99s, from=20
the Isaria Meter Works, etc. Along the left wall they had pushed=20
ahead close to my table and were beginning to collect beer mugs;=20
that is, they kept ordering beer and putting the empty mugs under=20
the table. In this way, whole batteries grew up and it would have=20
surprised me if all had ended well this time.=20

After about an hour and a half =E2=80=94 I was able to talk that long=20
despite interruptions =E2=80=94 it seemed almost as if I was going to be=20
master of the situation. The leaders of the invading troops=20
seemed to feel this themselves; for they were becoming more and=20
more restless, they often went out, came in again, and talked to=20
their men with visible nervousness.=20

A small psychological mistake I committed in warding off=20
an interruption, and which I myself realized no sooner had I=20
let the word out of my mouth, gave the signal for them to start=20
in.=20

A few angry shouts and a man suddenly jumped on a chair and=20
roared into the hall: =E2=80=98 Freiheit !=E2=80=99 1 (Freedom.) At which s=
ignal the=20
fighters for freedom began their work.=20

In a few seconds the whole hall was filled with a roaring,=20
screaming crowd, over which, like howitzer shells, flew innumer=C2=AC=20
able beer mugs, and in between the cracking of chair-legs, the=20
crashing of the mugs, bawling, howling, and screaming.=20

It was an idiotic spectacle.=20

I remained standing in my place and was able to observe how=20
thoroughly my boys fulfilled their duty.=20

I should have liked to see a bourgeois meeting under such cir=C2=AC=20
cumstances.=20

The dance had not yet begun when my storm troopers =E2=80=94 for so=20
they were called from this day on =E2=80=94 attacked. Like wolves they=20
flung themselves in packs of eight or ten again and again on their=20
enemies, and little by little actually began to thrash them out of=20
the hall. After only five minutes I hardly saw a one of them who=20

1 Greeting and slogan of the German Social Democrats.=20


506=20


Mein Kampf=20


was not covered with blood. How many of them I only came=20
really to know on that day; at the head my good Maurice, 1 my=20
present private secretary Hess, and many others, who, even=20
though gravely injured themselves, attacked again and again as=20
long as their legs would hold them. For twenty minutes the hellish=20
tumult lasted, but then our enemies, who must have numbered=20
seven and eight hundred men, had for the most part been beaten=20
out of the hall and chased down the stairs by my men numbering=20
not even fifty. Only in the left rear corner of the hall a big group=20
stood its ground and offered embittered resistance. Then sud=C2=AC=20
denly two shots were fired from the hall entrance toward the plat=C2=AC=20
form, and wild shooting started. Your heart almost rejoiced at=20
such a revival of old war experiences.=20

Who was shooting could not be distinguished from that point=20
on; only one thing could be definitely established, that from this=20
point on the fury of my bleeding boys exceeded all bounds and=20
finally the last disturbers were overcome and driven out of the hall.=20

About twenty-five minutes had passed; the hall looked almost=20
as if a shell had struck it. Many of my supporters were being=20
bandaged; others had to be driven away, but we had remained=20
masters of the situation. Hermann Esser, who had assumed the=20
chair this evening, declared '/The meeting goes on. T he speaker has=20
the floor.=E2=80=99 And then I spoke again.=20

After we ourselves had closed the meeting, an excited police=20
lieutenant came dashing in, and, wildly swinging his arms, he=20
cackled into the hall: =E2=80=98The meeting is dismissed/=20

Involuntarily I had to laugh at this late-comer; real police=20
pompousness. The smaller they are, the bigger they have to try=20
and look at least. 2=20

CHAPTER=20

VIII=20


The Strong Man Is Mightiest Alone 1=20


In the above I have already mentioned the=20
existence of a Working Federation of German Folkish Associations ,=20
and in this place would like to discuss very briefly the problem of=20
these working federations.=20

In general we understand by a working federation a group of=20
associations which for the facilitation of their work enter into a=20
certain mutual relationship, choose a common leadership of=20
greater or lesser competence, and proceed to carry out common=20
actions. From this alone it results that we must be dealing with=20
clubs, associations, or parties whose aims and methods do not lie=20
too far apart. It is claimed that this is always the case. For the=20
usual average citizen it is equally pleasant and comforting to hear=20
that such associations, by combining in such a =E2=80=98working federa=C2=
=AC=20
tion,=E2=80=99 have discovered a =E2=80=98common bond=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=
=98set aside all dividing=20
factorsd Here the general conviction prevails that such a unifica=C2=AC=20
tion brings an enormous increase in strength, and that the other=C2=AC=20
wise weak little groups have thereby suddenly become a power.=20

This , however , is usually false.=20

It is interesting and in my eyes important for the better under=C2=AC=20
standing of this question to attain clarity as to how associations,=20
clubs, and the like can arise which all claim to pursue the same=20
goal. In the nature of things, it would after all be logical that one=20
goal should be advocated by only one association, and that, rea-=20

1 Familiar quotation from Schiller=E2=80=99s Wilhelm Tell , Act I, Scene II=
I.=20




Right of Priority=20


509=20


sonably speaking, several associations should not pursue the=20
same goal. Without doubt that goal had first been envisaged by=20
one association. One man somewhere proclaims a truth and forms=20
a movement which is intended to serve the realization of his pur=C2=AC=20
pose.=20

Thus, an association or a party is founded which, according to=20
its program, should either bring about the elimination of existing=20
evils or the achievement of a particular state of affairs in the=20
future.=20

Once such a movement has been called to life, it possesses a=20
certain practical right of priority . It should really be obvious that=20
all men who mean to fight for the same goal should join into such=20
a movement and thereby add to its strength, thus better to serve=20
the common purpose. Especially every active mind must feel that=20
the premise for any real success in the common struggle lies in=20
such a coordination. Therefore, reasonably, and presupposing a=20
certain honesty (much depends on this, as I shall later demon=C2=AC=20
strate), there should be only one movement for one goal.=20

That this is not the case can be attributed to two causes. One=20
of these I might designate as almost tragic, while the second is=20
miserable and to be sought in human weakness itself, But most=20
fundamentally, I see in both only facts which are suited to en=C2=AC=20
hancing the will as such, its energy and intensity, and, through=20
this higher cultivation of human energy, ultimately to make pos=C2=AC=20
sible a solution of the problem in question.=20

The tragic reason why in the solution of a single task we usually=20
do not content ourselves with a single association is the following:=20
Every deed in the grand manner on this earth will in general be=20
the fulfillment of a desire which had long since been present in=20
millions of people, a longing silently harbored by many. Yes, it=20
can come about that centuries wish and yearn for the solution of a=20
certain question, because they are sighing beneath the intolerable=20
burden of an existing condition and the fulfillment of this general=20
longing does not materialize. Nations which no longer find any=20
heroic solution for such distress can be designated as impotentj=20
while we see the vitality of a people, and the predestination for=20


510=20


Mein Kampf=20


life guaranteed by this vitality, most strikingly demonstrated=20
when, for a people=E2=80=99s liberation from a great oppression, or for the=
=20
elimination of a bitter distress, or for the satisfaction of its soul,=20
restless because it has grown insecure =E2=80=94 Fate some day bestows=20
upon it the man endowed for this purpose, who finally brings the=20
long yearned-for fulfillment.=20

Now it lies entirely in the essence of so-called great questions of=20
the day that thousands are active in their solution, that many feel=20
called, indeed, that Fate itself puts forward many for selection,=20
and then ultimately, in the free play of forces, gives victory to the=20
stronger and more competent, entrusting him with the solution=20
of the problem.=20

Thus, it may be that centuries, dissatisfied with the form of=20
their religious life, yearn for a renewal, and that from this psychic=20
urge dozens and more men arise who on the basis of their insight=20
and their knowledge believe themselves chosen to solve this=20
religious distress, to manifest themselves as prophets of a new=20
doctrine, or at least as warriors against an existing one.=20

Here, too, assuredly, by virtue of a natural order, the strongest=20
man is destined to fulfill the great mission; yet the realization that=20
this one is the exclusively elect usually comes to the others very=20
late. On the contrary, they all see themselves as chosen and=20
having equal rights for the solution of the task, and their fellow=20
men are usually able least of all to distinguish which among them=20

being solely endowed with the highest ability =E2=80=94 deserves their=20
sole support.=20

Thus, in the course of centuries, often indeed within the same=20
period, different men appear and found movements to fight for=20
goals which, allegedly at least, are the same or at least are felt to=20
be the same by the great masses. The common people themselves=20
harbor indefinite desires and have general convictions, but cannot=20
obtain precise clarity regarding the actual nature of their aim or of=20
their own desire, let alone the possibility of its fulfillment.=20

The tragedy lies in the fact that these men strive for the same=20
goal in entirely different ways, without knowing one another,=20
and hence, with the highest faith in their own mission, consider=20


Struggle eor Leadership=20


511=20


themselves obligated to go their own ways without consideration=20
for others.=20

The fact that such movements, parties, religious groups, arise=20
entirely independent of one another, solely from the general will=20
of the times to act in the same direction, is what, at least at first=20
sight, seems tragic, because people incline too much to the opinion=20
that the forces scattered among the different ways, could, if con=C2=AC=20
centrated upon a single one, lead more quickly and surely to suc=C2=AC=20
cess. This, however, is not the case. For Nature itself in its in=C2=AC=20
exorable logic makes the decision, by causing the different groups=20
to enter into competition with one another and struggle for the=20
palm of victory, and leads that movement to the goal which has=20
chosen the clearest, shortest, and surest way.=20

But how should the correctness or incorrectness of a road be=20
determined from outside unless free course is given to the play of=20
forces, unless the ultimate decision is withdrawn from the doctri=C2=AC=20
naire opinion of human know-it-alls and entrusted to the infallible=20
logic of visible success, which in the end will always render the=20
ultimate confirmation of an action=E2=80=99s correctness!=20

And so if different groups march toward the same goal on=20
separate paths, once they have become aware of the existence of=20
similar efforts, they will more thoroughly examine the nature of=20
their own way; where possible they will shorten it, and by stretch=C2=AC=20
ing their energy to the utmost will strive to reach the goal more=20
quickly.=20

This competition helps to cultivate the individual fighter, and=20
mankind often owes its successes in part to the doctrines that=20
have been derived from the ill fate of previous unsuccessful efforts.=20

And so, in the fact of an incipient scattering of forces, which=20
arose through no conscious fault of individuals and at first sight=20
seemed tragic, we can recognize the means through which in the=20
end the best method was achieved.=20

We see in history that in the opinion of most people the two=20
roads which it was once possible to take for the solution of the=20
German question and whose chief representatives and champions=20
were Austria and Prussia, Habsburg and Hohenzollern, should=20


512=20


Mein Kampf=20


have been joined together from the start; in their view, people=20
should have entrusted themselves with united strength to the one=20
or the other road. And then the road of the representative who in=20
the end proved more significant would have been taken; the=20
Austrian intention, however, would never have led to a German=20
Reich.=20

And then the Reich of strongest German unity arose from the very=20
thing which millions of Germans with bleeding heart felt to be the=20
ultimate and most terrible sign of our fratricidal quarrel: the German=20
imperial throne was in truth won on the field of Kdniggratz and not in=20
the battles outside Paris as people afterwards came to think .=20

And thus the founding of the German Reich as such was not the=20
result of any common will along common paths, but the result of a=20
conscious and sometimes unconscious struggle for hegemony, from=20
which struggle Prussia ultimately issued victorious. And any=C2=AC=20
one who is not blinded by party politics into renouncing the=20
truth, will have to confirm that so-called human wisdom would=20
never have made the same wise decision which the wisdom of life,=20
that is, the free play of forces, finally turned into reality. For=20
who in German territories two hundred years ago would seriously=20
have believed that the Prussia of the Hohenzollerns would some=20
day become the germ cell, founder, and mentor of the new German=20
Reich, and not the Habsburgs? And who, on the other hand,=20
would deny today that Destiny acted more wisely in this respect;=20
in fact, who today could even conceive of a German Reich based=20
on the principles of a rotten and degenerate dynasty?=20

No, the natural development, though after a struggle enduring=20
centuries, finally brought the best man to the place where he be=C2=AC=20
longed.=20

This will always be so and will eternally remain so, as it always=20
has been so.=20

Therefore, it must not be lamented if so many men set out on=20
the road to arrive at the same goal: the most powerful and swiftest=20
will in this way be recognized, and will be the victor.=20

Now there is a second reason why often in the life of nations=20
movements of apparently the same nature nevertheless try to=20


Causes of =E2=80=98Folkish Splintering=E2=80=99=20


513=20


reach the same goal in different ways. This cause not only is not=20
tragic, but is positively miserable. It lies in the sorry mixture of=20
envy, jealousy, ambition, and thievish mentality which unfortu=C2=AC=20
nately we sometimes find combined in individual specimens of=20
mankind.=20

For as soon as a man appears who profoundly recognizes the=20
distress of his people and then, after he has attained the ultimate=20
clarity with regard to the nature of the disease, seriously tries to=20
cure it, when he has set a goal and chosen the road that can lead=20
to this goal =E2=80=94 immediately small and petty minds take notice=20
and begin to follow eagerly the activity of this man who has at=C2=AC=20
tracted the public eye. These people are just like sparrows who,=20
apparently uninterested, but in reality most attentive, keep=20
watching a more fortunate comrade who has found a piece of=20
bread, in hopes of suddenly robbing him in an unguarded moment.=20
A man need only embark upon a new road and all sorts of lazy=20
loiterers prick up their ears and sniff some worth-while morsel=20
which might lie at the end of this road. Then, as soon as they=20
have found out where it may be, they eagerly start out in order to=20
reach the goal by some other road, if possible a shorter one.=20

So if a new movement has been founded and has received its=20
definite program, those people come and claim to be fighting for=20
the same goal; but, rest assured, not by honestly joining the ranks=20
of such a movement and thus recognizing its priority; no, they=20
steal the program and base a new party of their own upon it.=20
With all this, they are shameless enough to assure their thought=C2=AC=20
less fellow men that they had desired the same as the other move=C2=AC=20
ment long before, and not seldom they thus succeed in placing=20
themselves in a favorable light, instead of winning universal con=C2=AC=20
tempt as they deserve. For is it not a tremendous gall to aspire to=20
write on their own banner the task that another has written on=20
his, to borrow his programmatical principles, and then, as though=20
he had created all this, to go his own ways? And the gall is espe=C2=AC=20
cially manifested in the fact that the same elements who have=20
caused the split by founding their new movements ao the most=20
talking, as experience shows, about the need of unification and=20


514=20


Mein Kampf=20


unity as soon as they think they have observed that the opponent=20
has too much of a headstart to be overtaken.=20

The so-called Tolkish splintering=E2=80=99 is due to such a process.=20

To be sure, the foundation in 1918-19 of a considerable number=20
of groups, parties, etc., designated as folkish, occurred through=20
the natural development of things through no fault of the found=C2=AC=20
ers. From all these the NSDAP had slowly crystallized out as the=20
victor by 1920. The basic honesty of those individual founders=20
could be proved by nothing more splendidly than by the truly=20
admirable decision taken by many to sacrifice their own obviously=20
less successful movements to the stronger one; that is, to disband=20
them or fuse them unconditionally.=20

This applies especially to the chief fighter of the German-=20
Socialist Party (. Deutsch-Sozialistische Partei) of those days in=20
Nuremberg, Julius Streicher. 1 The NSDAP and the DSP had=20
arisen with the same ultimate aims, yet absolutely independently=20
of one another. The main fighter for the DSP, as I have said, was=20
Julius Streicher, then a teacher in Nuremberg. At first he, too,=20
had a holy conviction of the mission and the future of his move=C2=AC=20
ment. But as soon as he could recognize the greater power and=20
superior growth of the NSDAP clearly and beyond all doubt, he=20
ceased his activity for the DSP and the Working Federation, and=20
called on his adherents to join the NSDAP, which had issued=20
victoriously from the mutual struggle, and to fight on in its ranks=20
for the common goal. A decision as grave from the personal point=20
of view as it was profoundly decent.=20

And no form of split has remained from this first period of the=20
movement; the honorable intention of the men of those days led=20
almost entirely to an honorable, straight, and correct conclusion.=20

1 Julius Streicher, Gauleiter of Nuremberg and publisher of the anti-=20
Semitic paper Der Stiirmer, devoted chiefly to pornographic exposures of=20
sexual relations between Jews and Aryans, retained until the Second War a=
=20
local independence enjoyed by no other party leader. His fusion with Hitler=
=20
was not as peaceable as Hitler makes it.=20

In 1921, Streicher tried to wrest the party leadership from Hitler, but=20
failed because of a revolt in the ranks of his own Nuremberg supporters.=20


=E2=80=98Working Federations'=20


515=20


What we designate today as =E2=80=98folkish splintering' owes its exist=C2=
=AC=20
ence, as we have already emphasized, exclusively to the second of=20
the two causes I have cited: ambitious men who previously had=20
no ideas, much less goals of their own, felt themselves =E2=80=98 called' a=
t=20
the very moment in which they saw the success of the NSDAP=20
undeniably maturing.=20

Suddenly programs arose which from start to finish were copied=20
from ours, ideas were put forward which had been borrowed from=20
us, aims set up for which we had fought for years, roads chosen=20
which the NSDAP had long traveled. By every possible means=20
they sought to explain why they had been forced to found these=20
movements despite the NSDAP which had long been in existence;=20
but the nobler the alleged motives, the falser were their phrases.=20

In truth a single reason had been determining: the personal ambi=C2=AC=20
tion of the founders to play a role to which their own dwarfish figure=20
really brought nothing except a great boldness in taking over the ideas=20
of others , a boldness which elsewhere in civil life is ordinarily desig=C2=
=AC=20
nated as crooked .=20

There was no conception or idea belonging to other people,=20
which one of these political kleptomaniacs did not rapidly collect=20
for his own business. And those who did this were the same people=20
who later with tears in their eyes profoundly bemoaned the=20
=E2=80=98folkish splintering' and spoke incessantly of the =E2=80=98need fo=
r unity,'=20
in the secret hope that in the end they would so outwit the others=20
that, weary of the eternal accusing clamor, they would, in addition=20
to the stolen ideas, toss the movements created for their execution=20
to the thieves.=20

But if this proved unsuccessful, and if, thanks to the small in=C2=AC=20
tellectual dimensions of their owners, the new enterprises did not=20
prove as profitable as they had hoped, they usually reduced their=20
prices and considered themselves happy if they could land in one=20
of the so-called working federations .=20

Everyone who at that time could not stand on his own feet=20
joined in such working federations; no doubt proceeding from the=20
belief that eight cripples joining arms are sure to produce one=20
gladiator.=20


516=20


Mein Kampf=20


And if there were really one healthy man among the cripples, he=20
used up all his strength just to keep the others on their feet / and=20
in this way was himself crippled.=20

We have always regarded fusion in so-called working federa=C2=AC=20
tions as a question of tactics; but in this we must never depart=20
from the following basic realization:=20

By the formation of a working federation weak organizations are=20
never transformed into strong ones, but a strong organization can and=20
will not seldom be weakened. The opinion that a power factor must=20
result from an association of weak groups is incorrect, since the=20
majority in any form whatsoever and under all presuppositions will,=20
as experience shows, be the representative of stupidity and cowardice,=20
and therefore any multiplicity of organizations, as soon as it is=20
directed by a self-chosen multiple leadership, is sacrificed to cowardice=
=20
and weakness. Also, by such a fusion, the free play of forces is=20
thwarted, the struggle for the selection of the best is stopped, and hence=
=20
the necessary and ultimate victory of the healthier and stronger pre=C2=AC=
=20
vented forever. Therefore, such fusions are enemies of natural=20
development, for usually they hinder the solution of the problem=20
being fought for, far more than they advance it.=20

It can occur that from purely tactical considerations the top=20
leadership of a movement which looks into the future neverthe=C2=AC=20
less enters into an agreement with such associations for a short=20
time as regards the treatment of definite questions and perhaps=20
undertakes steps in common. But this must never lead to the=20
perpetuation of such a state of affairs, unless the movement=20
itself wants to renounce its redeeming mission. For once it has=20
become definitely involved in such a union, it loses the possibility=20
and also the right of letting its own strength work itself out to the=20
full and thus overcome its rivals and victoriously achieve the goal=20
it has set itself.=20

It must never be forgotten that nothing that is really great in this=20
world has ever been achieved by coalitions , but that it has always been=20
the success of a single victor. Coalition successes bear by the very=20
nature of their origin the germ of future crumbling , in fact of the loss=
=20
of what has already been achieved. Great, truly world-shaking revolu-=20

tions of a spiritual nature are not even conceivable and realizable ex=C2=
=AC=20
cept as the titanic struggles of individual formations, never as enter=C2=
=AC=20
prises of coalitions.=20

And thus the folkish state above all will never be created by the com=C2=AC=
=20
promising will of a folkish working federation, but solely by the iron=20
will of a single movement that has fought its way to the top against all.=

Basic Ideas Regarding the Meaning and=20
Organization of the SA=20


- T he strength of the old state rested on=20

three pillars: the monarchistic state form, the civil service, and=20
the army. The revolution of 1918 eliminated the state form, dis=C2=AC=20
integrated the army, and delivered the civil service to party=20
corruption. Thus the most essential pillars of a so-called state=20
authority were shattered. State authority as such rests almost=20
always on the three elements which lie at the basis of all author=C2=AC=20
ity.=20

V=20

The first foundation for the creation of authority is always=20
provided by popularity. But an authority which rests solely on=20
this foundation is still extremely weak, uncertain, and shaky.=20
Every bearer of such an authority based purely on popularity=20
must, therefore, endeavor to improve and secure the foundation=20
of this authority by the creation of power. In power , therefore , in=20
force , we see the second foundation of all authority. It is already=20
considerably more stable and secure, but by no means always=20
stronger than the first. If popularity and force are combined , and=20
if in common they are able to survive for a certain time , an authority=20
on an even firmer basis can arise , the authority of tradition. If=20
finally , popularity , force, and tradition combine , an authority may=20
be regarded as unshakable.=20

Through the revolution this last case was completely excluded.=20
Indeed, there is no longer even an authority of tradition. With=20
the collapse of the old Reich, the elimination of the old state=20



The Three Foundations op Authority=20


519=20


form, the destruction of the former sovereign emblems and sym=C2=AC=20
bols of the Reich, tradition was abruptly broken off. The conse=C2=AC=20
quence of this was the gravest shaking of state authority.=20

Even the second pillar of state authority, force , was no longer=20
present. In order to carry out the revolution in the first place, it=20
was necessary to disintegrate the embodiment of the organized=20
force and power of the state, the army; indeed, it was necessary=20
to use the infected parts of the army itself as revolutionary fight=C2=AC=
=20
ing elements. Even though the front-line armies had not suc=C2=AC=20
cumbed to this disintegration in a uniform degree, they, never=C2=AC=20
theless, the more they felt the glorious sites of their four and a=20
half years of heroic struggle behind them, were corroded more and=20
more by the homeland=E2=80=99s acid of disorganization, and, arrived in=20
the demobilization organizations, likewise ended up in the confu=C2=AC=20
sion of so-called voluntary obedience belonging to the epoch of the=20
soldiers=E2=80=99 councils.=20

Naturally no authority could be based on these mutinous bands=20
of soldiers, who conceived of military service in terms of the=20
eight-hour day. And thus the second element, the element which=20
guarantees the firmness of authority, was also eliminated and the=20
revolution now possessed only the original element, popularity , on=20
which to build its authority. But this particular basis was ex=C2=AC=20
tremely uncertain. To be sure, the revolution succeeded in shat=C2=AC=20
tering the old state structure with one mighty blow, but at bot=C2=AC=20
tom only because the normal balance within the structure of our=20
people had already been eliminated by the war.=20

Every national body can be divided into three great classes:=20
into an extreme of the best humanity on the one hand, good in=20
the sense of possessing all virtues, especially distinguished by=20
courage and self-sacrifice; on the other hand, an extreme of the=20
worst human scum, bad in the sense that all selfish urges and vices=20
are present. Between the two extremes there lies a third class,=20
the great, broad, middle stratum, in which neither brilliant hero=C2=AC=20
ism nor the basest criminal mentality is embodied.=20

Times when a nation is rising are distinguished , in fact exist=20
only, by ihe absolute leadership of the extreme best part.=20


520=20


Mein Kampe=20


Times of a normal , even development or of a stable state of affairs=20
are distinguished and exist by the obvious domination of the elements=20
of the middle , in which the two extremes mutually balance one an=C2=AC=20
other , or cancel one another.=20

Times when a nation is collapsing are determmed by the dominant=20
activity 'of the worst elements.=20

In this connection it is noteworthy that the broad masses, the=20
class of the middle as I shall designate them, only manifest them=C2=AC=20
selves perceptibly when the two extremes are locked in mutual=20
struggle, but that in case of the victory of one of the extremes,=20
they complaisantly submit to the victor. In case the best people=20
dominate,, the broad masses will follow them; in case the worst=20
element rises up, they will at least offer them no resistance; for=20
the masses of the middle themselves will never fight.=20

Now the war, with its four and a half years of bloody events*=20
disturbed the inner balance of these three classes, in so far as =E2=80=94=
=20
though recognizing all the sacrifices and victims of the middle =E2=80=94=
=20
we must nevertheless recognize that it drained the extreme of the=20
best humanity almost entirely of its blood. For the amount of=20
irreplaceable German heroes=E2=80=99 blood that was shed in these four=20
and a half years was really enormous. Just sum up all the hun=C2=AC=20
dreds of thousands of individual cases in which again and again=20
the watchword was: volunteers to the front, volunteer patrols,=20
volunteer dispatch carriers, volunteers for telephone squads, volun~=20
leers for bridge crossings, volunteers for U-boats, volunieeers for=20
airplanes, volunteers for storm battalions, etc. =E2=80=94 again and again=
=20
through four and a half years, on thousands of occasions, volun=C2=AC=20
teers and more volunteers =E2=80=94 and always you see the same result:=20
the beardless youth or the mature man, both filled with fervent=20
love of their fatherland, with great personal courage or the highest=20
consciousness of duty, they stepped forward. Tens of thousands,=20
yes, hundreds of thousands of such cases occurred, and gradually=20
this human element became sparser and sparser. Those who did=20
not fall were either shot to pieces and crippled, or they gradually=20
crumbled away as a result of their small remaining number.=20
Consider above all that the year 1914 set up whole armies of so-=20


Survival of the Inferior=20


521=20


called volunteers who, thanks to the criminal unscrupulousness=20
of our parliamentary good-for-nothings, had received no ade=C2=AC=20
quate peacetime training, and thus became helpless cannon fod=C2=AC=20
der at the mercy of the enemy. The four hundred thousand who=20
then fell or were maimed in the battles of Flanders could not be=20
replaced. Their loss was more than the loss of a mere number.=20
By their loss the scale, too lightly weighted on the good side, shot=20
upward, and the elements of baseness, treachery, cowardice, in=20
short, the mass of the bad extreme, weighed more heavily than=20
before.=20

For one more factor was added:=20

Not only that the extreme of the best had been most fright=C2=AC=20
fully thinned on the battlefields in the course of the four and a=20
half years, but the bad extreme had meanwhile preserved itself=20
in the most miraculous way. For every hero who had volunteered=20
and mounted the steps of Valhalla after a heroic death, you can=20
be sure there was a slacker who had cautiously turned his back on=20
death, in order to engage in more or less useful activity at home.=20

And so the end of the War gives us the following picture: The=20
middle broad stratum of the nation has given its measure of blood=20
sacrifices; the extreme of the best, with exemplary heroism, has=20
sacrified itself almost completely; the extreme of the bad, sup=C2=AC=20
ported by the most senseless laws on the one hand and by the=20
non-application of the Articles of War on the other hand, has un=C2=AC=20
fortunately been preserved almost as completely.=20

This well-preserved scum of our people then made the revo=C2=AC=20
lution and was able to make it only because no longer opposed by=20
the extreme of the best elements: =E2=80=94 they were no longer among=20
the living.=20

This, however, made the German revolution only a relatively=20
popular affair from the start. It was not the German people as=20
such that committed this act of Cain, but its deserters, pimps, and=20
other rabble that shun the light.=20

The man at the front welcomed the end of the bloody struggle;=20
he was glad to return home again, to see his wife and children.=20
But with the revolution itself he had at heart nothing in common;=20


522=20


Mein Kampf=20


he did not love it, and even less did he love its instigators and=20
organizers. In the four and a half years of hardest struggle he=20
had forgotten the party hyenas, and all their quarrels had grown=20
alien to him.=20

Only with a small part of the German people had the revolution=20
really been popular: among that class of its helpers who had=20
chosen the knapsack 1 as the badge of recognition of all honorable=20
citizens of this new state. They did not love revolution for its=20
own sake, as some people erroneously still believe today, but be=C2=AC=20
cause of its consequences.=20

In truth, these Marxist gangsters could hardly base an author=C2=AC=20
ity on popularity for any length of time. And yet precisely the=20
young Republic needed authority at any price, if after a brief -=20
chaos it did not want to be suddenly devoured by a force of re=C2=AC=20
tribution gathering from the last elements of the good-part of our=20
people.=20

There was nothing they more feared, those champions of the re=C2=AC=20
volution, than to lose all foothold in the whirlpool of their own=20
confusion, and suddenly to be seized by an iron fist, such as more=20
than once in such periods has grown out of the life of peoples, and=20
have the ground shifted under them. The Republic had to con=C2=AC=20
solidate itself at any price.=20

And so it was compelled almost instantaneously to create, by=20
the side of the tottering pillar of its weak popularity, an organiza=C2=AC=
=20
tion of force, in order to base a firmer authority upon it.=20

When in the days of December, January, February of 1918-19=20
the matadors of the revolution felt the ground trembling beneath=20
their feet, they looked around for men who would be ready to=20
strengthen the weak position which the love of their people of=C2=AC=20
fered them, by the force of arms. The =E2=80=98 anti-militaristic =E2=80=99=
 Republic=20
needed soldiers. But since the first and sole support of their state=20
authority =E2=80=94 popularity =E2=80=94 rooted only in the society of pimp=
s,=20
thieves, burglars, deserters, slackers, etc., in other words, in that=20
part of the people which we must designate as the bad extreme =E2=80=94=20
every effort to recruit men who were prepared to sacrifice their=20

1 See page 437, note.=20


The Rise of the Free Corps=20


523=20


own lives in the service of the new ideal in these circles, was=20
love=E2=80=99s labor lost. The class supporting the revolutionary idea=20
and carrying out the revolution was neither able nor willing to pro=C2=AC=
=20
vide the soldiers for its protection. For this class by no means=20
wanted the organization of a republican state body, but the disorgan=C2=AC=
=20
ization of the existing state body for the better satisfaction of their in=
=C2=AC=20
stincts. Their watchword was not: order and building up of the Ger=C2=AC=20
man Republic, but: pillage it.=20

And so the cry for help which the representatives of the people=20
let out in their agony of fear inevitably went unheard; on the con=C2=AC=20
trary, in fact, it aroused resistance and bitterness. For in such an=20
undertaking people felt a breach of loyalty and faith; in the for=C2=AC=20
mation of an authority based no longer solely on their popularity=20
but supported by force, they sensed the beginning of the struggle=20
against the one aspect of the revolution that was essential for=20
these elements: against the right to rob and the undisciplined=20
rule of a horde of thieves and plunderers who had broken out of=20
the prison walls and been freed of their chains, in short, of foul=20
rabble.=20

The representatives of the people could cry as much as they=20
liked; no one stepped forward from their ranks, and only the=20
answering cry, =E2=80=98 traitor,=E2=80=99 informed them of the state of mi=
nd of=20
those supporters of their popularity.=20

Then for the first time numerous young Germans once again=20
stood ready to button up their soldier=E2=80=99s tunics, to shoulder car=C2=
=AC=20
bine and rifle, and don their steel helmets in the service of Taw=20
and order=E2=80=99 as they thought, to oppose the destroyers of their=20
homes. As volunteer soldiers they banded into free corps and began ,=20
though grimly hating the revolution, to protect , and thus for practical-=
=20
purposes to secure, this same revolution.=20

This they did in the best good faith.=20

The real organizer of the revolution and its actual wirepuller,=20
the international Jew, had correctly estimated the situation.=20
The German people was not yet ripe for being forced into the=20
bloody Bolshevistic morass, as had happened ; ^ Russia. This was=20
due in large part to the greater racial unity that still existed be-=20


524=20


Mein Kampf=20


tween the German intelligentsia and the German manual worker.=20
Further in the great permeation of even the broadest strata of the=20
people with educated elements, such as prevailed only in the other=20
countries of Western Europe, but was totally lacking in Russia.=20
There the intelligentsia itself was in large part not of Russian=20
nationality or at least was of non-Slavic racial character. The=20
thin intellectual upper stratum of the Russia of that time could=20
at any time be removed, due to the total lack of connecting inter=C2=AC=20
mediary ingredients with the mass of the great people. And the=20
intellectual and moral level of these last was horribly low.=20

Once it was possible in Russia to incite the uneducated hordes=20
of the great masses, unable to read or write, against the thin intel=C2=AC=
=20
lectual upper crust that stood in no relation or connection to them,=20
the fate of the country was decided, the revolution had succeeded;=20
the Russian illiterate had thus become the defenseless- slave of his=20
Jewish dictators, who for their part, it must be admitted, were=20
clever enough to let this dictatorship ride on the phrase of =E2=80=98 peo=
=C2=AC=20
ple's dictatorship/=20

In Germany there was the following additional factor: As cer=C2=AC=20
tainly as the revolution could succeed only in consequence of the=20
gradual disintegration of the army, just as certainly the real=20
maker of the revolution and disintegrator of the army was not the=20
soldier at the front, but the more or less light-shy rabble which=20
either hung around the home garrisons or, supposedly =E2=80=98indis=C2=AC=
=20
pensable,=E2=80=99 were in the economic service somewhere. This army=20
was strengthened by tens of thousands of deserters, who were=20
able to turn their backs on the front without special risk. The=20
real coward at all times naturally shuns nothing so much as=20
death. And at the front, day after day, he faced death in thou=C2=AC=20
sands of different forms. If you want to hold weak, wavering or=20
actually cowardly fellows to their duty, there has at all times been=20
only one possibility: The deserter must know that his desertion brings=20
with it the very thing that he wants to escape. At the front a man can=20
die, as a deserter he must die. Only by such a Draconic threat=20
against any attempt at desertion can a deterring effect be ob=C2=AC=20
tained, not only for the individual, but for the whole army.=20


Deserters and Revolution=20


525=20


And here lay the meaning and purpose of the Articles of War.=20

It was lovely to believe that the great fight for the existence=20
of a people could be fought on the sole basis of voluntary loyalty=20
born out of and preserved by the realization of necessity. Volun=C2=AC=20
tary fulfillment of duty has always determined the best men in=20
their actions; but not the average. Therefore, such laws are neces=C2=AC=20
sary, as for example those against theft, which were not made for=20
those who are basically the most honest, but for the pusillanimous,=20
weak elements. Such laws, by frightening the bad, are intended=20
to prevent the development of a condition in which ultimately=20
the honest man is regarded as the stupider, and consequently peo=C2=AC=20
ple come more and more to the view that it is more expedient like=C2=AC=20
wise to participate in theft than to look on with empty hands, or=20
even to let themselves be robbed.=20

So it was false to believe that in a struggle, which by all human=20
prognosis might rage for years to come, we could dispense with=20
the instruments which the experience of many centuries, in fact=20
millenniums, showed to be those which, in the gravest times and=20
moments of the heaviest strain on the nerves, can compel weak=20
and uncertain men to the fulfillment of their duty.=20

For the volunteer hero we obviously needed no Articles of War,=20
but we did for the cowardly egotist, who in the hour of his peo=C2=AC=20
ple=E2=80=99s distress sets his own life higher than that of the totality.=
=20
Such a spineless weakling can only be deterred from giving in to=20
his cowardice by the application of the hardest penalty. When=20
men struggle ceaselessly with death and have to hold out for=20
weeks without rest in mud-filled shell holes, sometimes with the=20
worst possible food, the vacillating soldier cannot be held in line=20
by threatening him with prison or even the workhouse, but only=20
by ruthless application of the death penalty. For experience=20
shows that at such a time he regards prison as a thousand times=20
more attractive a place than the battlefield, considering that in=20
prison at least his invaluable life is not menaced. And the fact=20
that in the War the death penalty was excluded, that in reality=20
the Articles of War were thus suspended, had terrible conse=C2=AC=20
quences. An army of deserters, especially in 1918, poured into=20


526=20


Mein Kampf=20


the reserve posts and the home towns, and helped to form that=20
great criminal organization which, after November 7, 1918, we=20
suddenly beheld as the maker of the revolution.=20

The front itself really had nothing to do with it. All its mem=C2=AC=20
bers felt only a longing for peace. But in this very fact lay tremen=C2=AC=
=20
dous danger for the revolution. For when after the armistice the=20
German armies began to near home, the anxious question of the=20
revolutionaries was again and again: What will the front-line=20
troops do? Will the men in field gray stand for this?=20

In these weeks the revolution in Germany had to appear at=20
least outwardly moderate, if it did not want to run the risk of sud=C2=AC=
=20
denly being smashed to bits by a few German divisions. For if at=20
that time even a single divisional commander had taken the decision=20
to pull down the red rags with the help of his loyal and devoted divi=C2=AC=
=20
sion and to stand the 1 councils =E2=80=99 up against the wall, to break po=
ssible=20
resistance with mine-throwers and hand-grenades , the division in less=20
than four weeks would have swollen to an army of sixty divisions .=20
This made the Jewish wirepullers tremble more than anything=20
else. And precisely to prevent this, they had to cover the revolu=C2=AC=20
tion with a certain moderation; it could not take the form of Bol-=20
shevism, but, as things happened to stand, had to make a pre=C2=AC=20
tense of Taw and order.=E2=80=99 Hence the innumerable great conces=C2=AC=
=20
sions, the appeal to the old civil service personnel, to the old army=20
leaders. They were needed for a certain time at least, and only=20
after the Moors had done their duty, 1 could the wirepuller venture=20
to give them the kicks they had coming to them and take the=20
Republic out of the hands of the old state servants and surrender=20
it into the claws of the revolutionary vultures.=20

Only in this way could they hope to dupe old generals and old=20
civil officials, to disarm in advance any possible resistance on their=20
part by an apparent innocence and mildness in the new regime.=20

And practice showed to what an extent this succeeded.=20

However, the revolution had not been made by elements of law=20
and order, but by elements of riot, theft, and plunder. And for=20

=99s Fiesko. See=20
page 294, note.=20


Collaboration of the Left Parties=20


527=20


them, the development of the revolution neither accorded with=20
their will, nor for tactical reasons could the course of events be=20
explained and made palatable to them.=20

With the gradual growth of the Social Democracy, it had lost=20
more and more the character of a brutal revolutionary party.=20
Not that its thoughts had ever served any other goal than that of=20
the revolution, or that its leaders had ever had other intentions;=20
by no means. But what finally remained was only the purpose and=20
a body no longer suited to its execution. With a party of ten mil=C2=AC=20
lions it is no longer possible to make a revolution. In such a move=C2=AC=
=20
ment you no longer have an extreme of activity, but the great=20
mass of the middle, that is, of inertia.=20

Out of this realization, while the War was still going on, the=20
famous split of the Social Democracy by the Jews took place;=20
that is: while the Social Democratic Party, in keeping with the=20
inertia of its mass, hung on national defense like a lead weight,=20
the radical-activistic elements were drawn out of it and formed=20
into forceful new assault columns. The Independent Party and the=20
Spartacus League were the storm battalions of revolutionary Marx=C2=AC=20
ism. Their task was to create the accomplished fact, the ground=C2=AC=20
work of which could be taken over by the masses of the Social=20
Democratic Party, which had been prepared for this over a period=20
of decades. The cowardly bourgeoisie, however, was not rightly=20
estimated by the Marxists, and were simply treated 1 en canailleI=20
Of them no notice was taken whatever, for it was realized that=20
the doglike submissiveness of the political formations of an old=20
outlived generation would never be capable of serious resistance.=20

As soon as the revolution had succeeded and the main pillars of=20
the old state could be regarded as broken, but the front-line army,=20
marching home, began to appear as a terrifying sphinx, a brake=20
had to be applied to the natural development; the van of the So=C2=AC=20
cial Democratic army occupied the conquered position, and the=20
Independent and Spartacist storm battalions were shoved aside.=20

This, however, did not take place without a struggle.=20

Not only that the activistic assault formations of the revolu=C2=AC=20
tion were dissatisfied and felt cheated, and wanted to go on fight-=20


528=20


Mein Kampf=20


ing on their own hook, but their unruly rowdyism was only too=20
welcome to the wirepullers of the revolution. For no sooner was=20
the revolution over than there rose within it two apparent camps:=20
the party of law and order and the group of bloody terror. Now=20
what was more natural than that our bourgeoisie should at once,=20
with flying colors, move into the camp of law and order? Now,=20
all at once, these wretched political organizations had an oppor=C2=AC=20
tunity for an activity, in which, without being obliged to say so,=20
they nevertheless quietly found some ground beneath their feet=20
and came into a certain solidarity with the power which they=20
hated but even more fervently feared. The political German=20
bourgeoisie had received the high honor of being permitted to sit=20
down at the table with the accursed Marxist leaders to combat=20
the Bolshevists.=20

Thus, as early as December, 1918, and January, 1919, the fol=C2=AC=20
lowing condition took form:=20

With a minority of the worst elements a revolution has been=20
made, and immediately backed by all the Marxist parties. The=20
revolution itself has an apparently moderate stamp, which nets=20
it the hostility of the fanatical extremists. The latter begin to=20
shoot off machine guns and hand grenades, to occupy public=20
buildings, in short, to menace the moderate revolution. To=20
suppress the terror of such a further development, an armistice=20
is concluded between the supporters of the new state of affairs=20
and the adherents of the old one, for the purpose of carrying on=20
the struggle in common against the extremists. The result is that=20
the enemies of the Republic have given up their fight against the=20
Republic as such, and help to force down those who, though from=20
totally different angles, are likewise enemies of this Republic.=20
And the further result is that the danger of a struggle of the ad=C2=AC=20
herents of the old state against those of the new one seems defin=C2=AC=20
itely averted.=20

We cannot consider this fact often and closely enough. Only=20
those who understand it can realize how it was possible that a=20
people, nine tenths of whom did not make a revolution, seven=20
tenths of whom reject it, and six tenths of whom hated it,=20


Capitulation of the Bourgeoisie=20


529=20


nevertheless could have this revolution forced on them by one=20
tenth.=20

Gradually the Spartacist barricade fighters on the one hand and=20
the nationalist fanatics and idealists on the other were bled white,=20
and in exact proportion as the two extremes wore each other out,=20
as always, the mass of the middle was victorious. The bourgeoisie=20
and Marxism met on a =E2=80=98realistic basis/ and the Republic began=20
to be =E2=80=98consolidated.=E2=80=99 Which for the present, to be sure, di=
d not=20
prevent the bourgeois parties, especially before elections, from=20
citing the monarchist idea for a time, in order, by means of the=20
spirits of the past, to be able to conjure the smaller spirits of their=20
adherents and ensnare them once more.=20

Honorable this was not. At heart they had all broken with the=20
monarchy long since, and the filth of the new condition had begun=20
to spread its seductive influences to the bourgeois party camp.=20
The usual bourgeois politician feels more at home today in the=20
muck of republican corruption than in the clean hardness which=20
he still remembers from the past state.=20


tv* 7r=20


As already stated, the revolution, after the smashing of the old=20
army, had been forced to create a new power factor for the rein=C2=AC=20
forcement of its state authority. As things were, it could gain this=20
only from supporters of an outlook that was really opposed to it.=20
From them alone there could slowly arise a new army which, ex=C2=AC=20
ternally limited by the peace treaties, would, with regard to its=20
mentality, have to be reshaped in the course of time into an in=C2=AC=20
strument of the new state conception.=20

If we put to ourselves the question how =E2=80=94 aside from all the=20
real mistakes of the old state, which were among its causes =E2=80=94=20
the revolution as an action could succeed, we come to the con=C2=AC=20
clusion :=20

1. In consequence of the paralysis of our concepts of duty and=20
obedience , and=20


530=20


Mein Kampf=20


2. In consequence of the cowardly passivity of our so-called=20
state-preserving parties.=20

On these points the following may be said:=20

The paralysis of our concepts of duty and obedience has its=20
ultimate ground in our totally unnational education, oriented=20
solely toward the state. Here again this gives rise to a confusion=20
between means and end. Consciousness of duty, fulfillment of=20
duty, and obedience are not ends in themselves, any more than=20
the state is an end in itself; they should all be the means for mak=C2=AC=
=20
ing possible and safeguarding on this earth the existence of a com=C2=AC=20
munity of spiritually and physically homogeneous beings. In=20
an hour when a national body is visibly collapsing and to all ap=C2=AC=20
pearances is exposed to the gravest oppression , thanks to the activity=20
of a few scoundrels , obedience and fulfillment of duty toward them=20
amount to doctrinaire formalism, in fact pure insanity , if-the refusal=20
of obedience and 1 fulfillment of duty =E2=80=99 would make possible the sa=
lva=C2=AC=20
tion of a people from its ruin. According to our present-day bour=C2=AC=20
geois state conception, the divisional commander who at that=20
time received from above the command not to shoot, acted duti=C2=AC=20
fully and hence rightly in not shooting, since to bourgeois society,=20
thoughtless formal obedience is more valuable than the life of=20
their own people. According to the National Socialist conception,=20
however, it is not obedience toward weak superiors that goes into=20
force at such moments, but obedience toward the national com=C2=AC=20
munity. In such an hour, the duty of personal responsibility to=C2=AC=20
ward a whole nation manifests itself.=20

The fact that a living conception of these terms had been lost in=20
our people or rather in our governments, giving way to a purely=20
doctrinaire and formal conception, was the cause of the revolu=C2=AC=20
tion=E2=80=99s success.=20

On the second point, the following must be remarked:=20

The deeper reason for the cowardice of the =E2=80=98state-preserving=E2=80=
=99=20
parties is above all the departure of the activistic, well-intentioned=20
part of our people from their ranks =E2=80=94 those who bled to death in=20
the field. Aside from this, our bourgeois parties, which we can=20
designate as the sole political formations which supported the old=20


Capitulation to Marxism=20


531=20


state, were convinced that they were entitled to defend their=20
views exclusively in the spiritual way and with spiritual weapons,=20
since the use of physical weapons was the sole prerogative of the=20
state. Not only that in such a conception we must see a symptom=20
of a gradually developing decadent weakness, but it was also=20
senseless at a time when a political opponent had long since=20
abandoned this standpoint and openly emphasized his intention=20
of putting forward his political aims by force when possible.=20
At the moment when Marxism appeared in the world of bour=C2=AC=20
geois democracy, as one of its results, the bourgeois-democratic=20
appeal to carry on the struggle with =E2=80=98spiritual weapons=E2=80=99 wa=
s an=20
absurdity, which would one day bring dire consequences. For the=20
Marxists themselves from the very beginning came out for the=20
conception that the use of a weapon must be considered only ac=C2=AC=20
cording to criteria of expediency, and that the right to use it re=C2=AC=20
sides solely in success.=20

How correct this conception is was shown in the days of Novem=C2=AC=20
ber 7 to 11, 1918. In those days the Marxists did not concern=20
themselves in the least about parliamentarianism and democracy,=20
but gave both of them the death blow with yelling and shooting=20
mobs of criminals. It goes without saying that in this same mo=C2=AC=20
ment the bourgeois talking clubs were defenseless.=20

After the revolution, when the bourgeois parties suddenly re=C2=AC=20
appeared, though with modified firm names, and their brave=20
leaders crawled out of the concealment of dark cellars and airy=20
storerooms, like all the representatives of such formations, they=20
had not forgotten their mistakes and likewise they had learned=20
nothing new. Their political program lay in the past, in so far=20
as they had not reconciled themselves at heart with the new state=20
of affairs; their aim, however, was to participate if possible in the=20
new state of affairs, and their sole weapons remained, as they had=20
always been, words.=20

Even after the revolution, the bourgeois parties at all times=20
miserably capitulated to the streets.=20

When the Law for the Protection of the Republic 1 came up for=20

1 See page 270, note.=20


532=20


Mein Kampf=20


consideration, there was at first no majority in favor of it. But in=20
the face of the two hundred thousand demonstrating Marxists,=20
the bourgeois c statesmen=E2=80=99 were seized with such a fear that con=C2=
=AC=20
trary to their conviction they accepted the law, in the miserable=20
fear that otherwise when they left the Reichstag they would be=20
beaten to a pulp by the furious masses. Which unfortunately,=20
in consequence of the law=E2=80=99s acceptance, did not take place.=20

And so the development of the new state went its ways, as=20
though there had not been any national opposition at all.=20

The sole organizations which at this time would have had the=20
courage and strength to oppose the Marxists and their incited=20
masses, were for the present the free corps, later the self-defense=20
organizations, citizens=E2=80=99 guards, etc., and finally the tradition=20
leagues. 1=20

But why their existence brought about no sort of shift that was in=20
any way discernible was due to the following:=20

Just as the so-called national parties could exert no sort of in=C2=AC=20
fluence for lack of any threatening power on the streets , likewise the=20
so-called defense organizations , in turn , could exert no sort of in=C2=AC=
=20
fluence for lack of any political idea, and above all of any real=20
political goal .=20

What had given Marxism its success was its complete combination=20
of political will and activistic brutality . What excluded national=20
Germany from any practical activity in shaping the German develop=C2=AC=20
ment was the lack of a unified collaboration of brutal force with bril=C2=
=AC=20
liant political will.=20

Whatever the will of the =E2=80=98 national =E2=80=99 parties might be, the=
y had=20
not the least power to fight for this will, least of all on the=20
streets.=20

The combat leagues had all the power, they were the masters of=20
the streets and the state, and possessed no political idea and no=20
political goal for which their strength was or even could be=20
thrown in for the benefit of national Germany. In both cases it=20
was the slyness of the Jew who, by clever persuasion and insist=C2=AC=20
ence, was able to bring about a positive perpetuation, in any case=20

1 Veterans=E2=80=99 organizations based on glorification of the old army.=
=20


No Fighting Strength Without an Idea=20


533=20


an increasing intensification, of this calamitous state of affairs.=20

It was the Jew who through his press knew how to launch with=20
infinite dexterity the idea of the =E2=80=98unpolitical character=E2=80=99 =
of the=20
combat leagues, as, on the other hand, in political life he always=20
praised and encouraged, with equal slyness, the =E2=80=98purely spiritual=
=20
nature =E2=80=99 of the struggle. Millions of German blockheads babbled=20
this nonsense after him, without having even the faintest idea=20
that in this way they were for practical purposes disarming them=C2=AC=20
selves and exposing themselves defenseless to the Jew.=20

But for this, too, indeed, there is again a natural explanation.=20
The lack of a great , creative , renewing idea means at all times a limi=C2=
=AC=20
tation of fighting force. Firm belief in the right to apply even the most=
=20
brutal weapons is always bound up with the existence of a fanatical=20
faith in the necessity of the victory of a revolutionary new order on=20
this earth.=20

A movement that is not fighting for such highest aims and ideals=20
will, therefore , never seize upon the ultimate weapon.=20

The fact of having a new great idea to show was the secret of=20
the success of the French Revolution; the Russian Revolution=20
owes its victory to the idea, and only through the idea did fascism=20
achieve the power to subject a people in the most beneficial way=20
to the most comprehensive creative renewal.=20

Of this, bourgeois parties are not capable.=20

But it was not only the bourgeois parties that saw their political=20
goal in a restoration of the past, but also the combat leagues, in so=20
far as they concerned themselves with any political aims at all.=20
Old veterans=E2=80=99 club and Kyffhduser 1 tendencies were alive within=20
them and contributed to politically blunting the sharpest weapon=20
that national Germany had in those days and making it languish=20
in the mercenary service of the Republic. The fact that in this=20
they acted in the best conviction, and above all in the best good=20

1 Kyffhauserbund der deutschen Landeskriegerverbande, a veterans=E2=80=99 o=
rgani=C2=AC=20
zation founded in 1898. Before the War of 1914 it had over two million=20
members. It takes its name from the mountain in the Harz, within which,=20
according to the legend, Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa lies sleeping, to=20
awaken in the hour of Germany=E2=80=99s greatest need.=20


534=20


Mein Kampf=20


faith, changes nothing in the catastrophic madness of these oc=C2=AC=20
currences.=20

Gradually Marxism obtained the required power to support its=20
authority in the Reichswehr that was being consolidated, and=20
thereupon, consistently and logically, began to disband as=20
superfluous the nationalist combat leagues, which seemed dan=C2=AC=20
gerous. Individual leaders of especial boldness, who were looked=20
on with distrust, were haled before the bars of justice and put=20
behind Swedish curtains. 1 But with all of them the destiny for=20
which they themselves were responsible was fulfilled.=20


vv* W=20


With the founding of the NSDAP, for the first time a-movement=20
had appeared whose goal did not, like that of the bourgeois par=C2=AC=20
ties, consist in a mechanical restoration of the past, but in the=20
effort to erect an organic folkish state in place of the present sense=C2=
=AC=20
less state mechanism.=20

The young movement , from the first day , espoused the standpoint=20
that its idea must be put forward spiritually , but that the defense of=20
this spiritual platform must if necessary be secured by strong-arm=20
means. Faithful to its belief in the enormous significance of the=20
new doctrine, it seems obvious to the movement that for the at=C2=AC=20
tainment of its goal no sacrifice can be too great.=20

I have already pointed to the forces which obligate a move=C2=AC=20
ment, in so far as it wants to win the heart of a people, to assume=20
from its own ranks its defense against the terrorist attempts of=20
its adversaries. And it is an eternal experience of world history=20
that a terror represented by a philosophy of life can never be=20
broken by a formal state power, but at all times can be defeated=20
only by another, new philosophy of life, proceeding with the same=20
boldness and determination. This will at all times be displeasing=20
to the sentiment of the official guardians of the state, but that will=20
not banish the fact. State power can only guarantee law and=20

1 Thieves=E2=80=99 slang for prison bars.=20


Need for a Monitor Troop=20


535=20


order when the content of the state coincides with the philosophy=20
dominant at that particular time, so that violent elements possess=20
only the character of individual criminal natures, and are not re=C2=AC=20
garded as proponents of an idea in extreme opposition to the state=20
views. In such a case, the state can for centuries apply the great=C2=AC=20
est measures of violence against a terror oppressing it; in the end=20
it will nevertheless be able to do nothing against it, but will go=20
down in defeat.=20

The German state is gravely attacked by Marxism. In its=20
struggle of seventy years it has not been able to prevent the vic=C2=AC=20
tory of this philosophy of life, but, despite a sum total of thou=C2=AC=20
sands of years in prison and jail sentences and the bloodiest=20
measures which in innumerable cases it applied to the warriors=20
of the menacing Marxist philosophy, has nevertheless been forced=20
to almost total capitulation. (This, too, the run-of-the-mill=20
bourgeois political leader will want to deny, though obviously=20
he will be unable to convince anyone.)=20

The state which on November 9, 1918, unconditionally=20
crawled on its belly before Marxism will not suddenly arise to=C2=AC=20
morrow as its conqueror; on the contrary: even today feeble-=20
minded bourgeois in ministerial chairs are beginning to rave=20
about the necessity of not governing against the workers, and=20
what they have in mind under the concept 1 worker=E2=80=99 is Marxism.=20
But by identifying the German worker with Marxism, they not=20
only commit a falsification as cowardly as it is untrue, but at=C2=AC=20
tempt by this motivation to conceal their own collapse in the=20
face of the Marxist idea and organization.=20

But in view of this fact =E2=80=94 that is, the complete subjection of=20
the present state to Marxism =E2=80=94 the National Socialist movement=20
really acquires the duty, not only of preparing the victory of its=20
idea, but of taking over its defense against the terror of an In=C2=AC=20
ternational drunk with victory.=20

I have already described how in our movement a body for the=20
protection of meetings gradually developed out of practical life,=20
how it gradually assumed the character of a definite monitor=20
troop, and strove for an organizational form.=20


536=20


Mein Kampf=20


Much as this gradually arising body might outwardly resemble=20
a so-called combat league, it was nevertheless not to be compared=20
with one.=20

As already mentioned, the German combat organizations had=20
no definite political idea. They were really nothing but self-=20
defense leagues of more or less competent training and organiza=C2=AC=20
tion, with the result that they actually represented an illegal=20
complement to the state=E2=80=99s momentary instruments of power.=20
Their character of free corps was based only on the way in which=20
they were formed and on the condition of the state at that time,=20
but they were by no means deserving of such a title as free forma=C2=AC=20
tions of the struggle for a free conviction of their own. This, de=C2=AC=20
spite all the opposition of individual leaders and whole leagues=20
toward the Republic, they did not possess. For being convinced=20
of the inferiority of an existing condition does not suffice to entitle=20
one to speak of a conviction in the higher sense; no, the latter is rooted=
=20
only in the knowledge of a neiv condition and in the inner vision of=20
a condition the achievement of which one feels as a necessity , and=20
to stand up for whose realization one regards as one=E2=80=99s highest life=
 task .=20

What distinguishes the monitor troop of the National Socialist=20
organization of that time essentially from all combat leagues is=20
that it was not and did not want to be in any way a servant of the=20
conditions created by the revolution, but that it fought exclu=C2=AC=20
sively for a new Germany.=20

In the beginning, it is true, this monitor troop possessed only=20
the character of a meeting-hall guard. Its first task was a limited=20
one: it consisted in making it possible to hold meetings which=20
without it would have been simply prevented by the enemy.=20
Even then, it had been trained to carry out an attack blindly, but=20
not, as stupid German-folkish circles nonsensically claimed, be=C2=AC=20
cause it honored the blackjack as the highest spirit, but because=20
it understood that the greatest spirit can be eliminated when its=20
bearer is struck down with a blackjack, as in actual fact the most=20
significant heads in history have not seldom ended beneath the=20
blows of the pettiest helots. 1 They did not want to set up vio-=20

Failure of State Officials=20


537=20


lence as a goal, but to protect the prophets of the spiritual goal=20
from being shoved aside by violence. And in this they under=C2=AC=20
stood that they were not obligated to undertake the protection=20
of a state which offers the nation no protection, but that, on the=20
contrary, they had to assume the protection of a nation against=20
those who threatened to destroy the people and the state.=20

After the meeting-hall battle in the Munich Hofbrauhaus the=20
monitor troop, once and for all, in eternal memory of the heroic=20
storm attacks of the small number they were then, received the=20
name of Sturmabteilung (storm section). As this very designation=20
indicates, it represents only a section of the movement. It is a=20
link in it, just as propaganda, the press, the scientific institutes=20
and so forth, constitute mere links in the party.=20

How necessary its development was, we could see, not only by=20
this memorable meeting, but also by our attempt gradually to=20
spread our movement from Munich into the rest of Germany.=20
Once we had appeared dangerous to the Marxists, they missed=20
no opportunity to nip any attempt at a National Socialist meet=C2=AC=20
ing in the bud, or prevent it from being held by breaking it up.=20
And it was absolutely a matter of course that the party organiza=C2=AC=20
tions of all shadings of Marxism blindly supported any such in=C2=AC=20
tentions and any such occurrences in the representative bodies.=20
But what was one to say of bourgeois parties which themselves=20
had been so thrashed by the Marxists that in many places they=20
could no longer venture to have their speakers appear in public=20
and which, nevertheless, followed any struggles against Marxism=20
that in any way turned out unfavorably for us with an abso=C2=AC=20
lutely incomprehensible, idiotic satisfaction. They were happy=20
that the enemy which could not be bested by them, which on the=20
contrary bested them, could not be broken by us either. What=20
should be said of state officials, police presidents, nay, even=20
ministers, who with a really disreputable lack of principle liked=20
to represent themselves publicly as =E2=80=98national men/ but who in=20
all conflicts that we National Socialists had with the Marxists,=20
acted as tne most disgraceful stooges for them? What should be=20
said of men who went so far in their self-abasement that for a=20


538=20


Mein Kampe=20


pitiful word of praise in the Jewish newpsapers they did not hesi=C2=AC=20
tate to persecute the men to whose heroism in risking their own=20
lives they in part owed the fact that a few years previous they=20
were not tattered corpses hung up on lamp-posts by the Red=20
mob?=20

These were such sad figures that they once moved the unfor=C2=AC=20
gettable late President Pohner, who in his hard straightforward=C2=AC=20
ness hated all crawlers as only a man with an honest heart can=20
hate, to the harsh utterance: =E2=80=98All my life I wanted to be nothing=
=20
else than first a German and then an official, and I would never=20
like to be confused with those creatures who prostitute them=C2=AC=20
selves like official whores to everyone who can play the master at=20
the moment.=E2=80=99=20

And in all this it was especially sad that this kind of men gradu=C2=AC=20
ally gained power over tens of thousands of the most- honorable=20
and best German civil servants, but even gradually infected them=20
with their own disloyalty, and persecuted the honest ones with=20
grim hatred and finally drove them out of their posts and posi=C2=AC=20
tions, while they themselves, with lying hypocrisy, still repre=C2=AC=20
sented themselves as =E2=80=98national=E2=80=99 men.=20

From such men we could never hope for any support, and we=20
obtained it only in the very rarest cases. Solely the development=20
of our own defense organization could safeguard the activity of=20
the movement and at the same time win for it that public atten=C2=AC=20
tion and general respect which are accorded to the man who,=20
when attacked, takes up his own defense.=20

As the directing idea for the inner training of this storm sec=C2=AC=20
tion, the intention was always dominant, aside from all physical=20
education, to teach it to be an unshakable, convinced defender of=20
the National Socialist idea, and finally to strengthen its dis=C2=AC=20
cipline in the highest degree. It should have nothing in common=20
with a combat organization of bourgeois conception, but likewise=20
nothing in common with a secret organization.=20

The reason why, even at that time, I sharply opposed having=20
the SA of the NSDAP organized as a so-called combat league,=20
was based on the following consideration:=20


Why No Combat Leagues?=20


539=20


From the purely practical point of view, the military training of=20
a people cannot be carried out by private leagues, except with the=20
help of the most enormous state means. Any other belief is based=20
on great overestimation of their own ability. And so it is out of the=20
question that organizations possessing military value can be=20
built up beyond certain limits with so-called c voluntary disci=C2=AC=20
pline. J The most important support of the power to command is=20
lacking, to wit, the power to punish. To be sure, it was possible=20
in the fall, or even better in the spring of 1919, to set up so-called=20
Tree corps/ but not only did most of them possess front-line=20
fighters who had gone through the school of the old army, but=20
the type of obligation which they laid upon the individuals=20
subjected them, for a limited time at least, just as uncondition=C2=AC=20
ally to military obedience.=20

This is totally lacking in a voluntary =E2=80=98 combat organization =E2=80=
=99 of=20
today. The larger the league, the weaker its discipline will be, the=20
smaller the demands made on the individual men, and the more=20
the whole will take on the character of the old non-political sol=C2=AC=20
diers=E2=80=99 and veterans=E2=80=99 clubs.=20

It will never be possible to carry out a voluntary training for=20
army service among the great masses without guaranteed un=C2=AC=20
conditional power of command. Never will more than a few be=20
willing to submit of their own accord to such forced obedience=20
as was considered self-evident and natural in the army.=20

Furthermore, real training cannot be given in consequence of=20
the absurdly small means at the disposal of a so-called combat=20
league for such a purpose. But the best, most reliable training=20
should be precisely the main task of such an institution. Since the=20
War, eight years have gone by, and since that time not a single=20
age class among our German youth has been systematically=20
trained. But it cannot be the function of a combat league to=20
include the old classes that have already been trained, since=20
otherwise it can at once be reckoned mathematically when the=20
last member will leave this corporation. Even the youngest sol=C2=AC=20
dier of 1918 will in twenty years be incapable of fighting, and we=20
are approaching this moment with a disquieting speed. Thus=20


540=20


Mein Kampf=20


every so-called combat league must necessarily assume more and=20
more the character of an old soldiers=E2=80=99 association. This, however,=
=20
cannot be the purpose of an organization that designates itself=20
not as an old soldiers=E2=80=99 league, but as a Wehrverband (combat=20
league), and which by its very name endeavors to express the fact=20
that it sees its mission, not only in the preservation of the tradi=C2=AC=
=20
tion and common bond of former soldiers, but in the development=20
of the military (wehr) idea, and in the practical advocacy of this=20
idea, that is, in the creation of a military body.=20

This task, however, absolutely demands the training of ele=C2=AC=20
ments which had previously received no military drill, and this in=20
practice is actually impossible. With one or two hours training=20
a week, you really cannot make a soldier. With the present-day=20
enormously increased demands that warfare makes on the in=C2=AC=20
dividual, a two-year period service is perhaps just adequate to=20
transform an untrained young man into an expert soldier. We=20
have all of us in the field seen the terrible consequences that re=C2=AC=20
sulted for young soldiers not thoroughly trained in their trade.=20
Volunteer formations, which for fifteen or twenty weeks had been=20
drilled with iron determination and boundless devotion, never=C2=AC=20
theless represented nothing but cannon fodder at the front. Only=20
distributed among the ranks of experienced old soldiers could=20
younger recruits, trained for from four to six months, furnish=20
useful members of a regiment; even then they were directed by=20
the =E2=80=98old men=E2=80=99 and thus gradually grew into their functions.=
=20

How thoughtless in contrast seems an attempt to try to create=20
troops with a so-called training period of one or two hours a=20
week, without clear power of command and without extensive=20
means! It might be possible to freshen up old soldiers in this way,=20
but never to turn young men into soldiers.=20

How indifferent and totally worthless such a procedure would=20
be in its results can be demonstrated especially by the fact that,=20
while a so-called volunteer league, with puffing and blowing, with-=20
trouble and grief, trains or tries to train a few thousand essen=C2=AC=20
tially well-intentioned men (it does not get to any others) in the=20
military idea, the state itself, by the pacifistic-democratic nature=20


Why No Combat Leagues?=20


541=20


of its education, consistently robs millions and millions of young=20
people of their natural instincts, poisons their logical patriotic=20
thinking, and thus gradually transforms them into a herd of sheep,=20
patiently accepting every arbitrary tyranny.=20

How absurd, in comparison with this, are all the exertions of the=20
combat leagues to transmit their ideas to the German youth.=20

But almost more important is the following consideration,=20
which had always made me take a position counter to any at=C2=AC=20
tempt at a so-called military rearming on the basis of volunteer=20
leagues.=20

Assuming that despite the above-mentioned difficulties a=20
league nevertheless succeeded in training a definite number of=20
Germans year after year into arms-bearing men =E2=80=94 equally with=20
respect to their convictions as with respect to their physical fit=C2=AC=20
ness and schooling in the use of arms =E2=80=94 the result would never=C2=
=AC=20
theless be practically nil in a state which, by its whole tendency,=20
absolutely does not desire such military education, in fact posi=C2=AC=20
tively hates it, since it stands in complete contradiction to the=20
aim of its leaders =E2=80=94 the destroyers of this state.=20

In any case such a result would be worthless under govern=C2=AC=20
ments which have not only demonstrated by their deeds that they=20
care nothing about the military strength of the nation, but which=20
above all would never be willing to issue an appeal to this strength,=20
except at best for the support of their own ruinous existence.=20

And today this is the case. Or is it not absurd to try to train=20
some tens of thousands of men for a government in the dim light=20
of dawn and evening, when the state a few years previous dis=C2=AC=20
gracefully sacrified eight and a half millions of the best-trained=20
soldiers, not only ceasing to use them, but as thanks for their=20
sacrifices actually exposing them to general vilification? And so=20
they want to train soldiers for a state regime which befouled and=20
spat upon the most glorious soldiers of former days, tore theh=20
decorations from their chest, took away their cockades, trampled=20
their banners and degraded their achievements? Or has this=20
present state regime ever undertaken a single step to restore the=20
honor of the old army, to call to account those who have cor-=20


542=20


Mein Kampe=20


rupted and reviled it? Not in the slightest. On the contrary: we=20
can see these creatures enthroned in the highest state posts. =E2=80=94=20
Remember the words spoken at Leipzig: =E2=80=98Right goes with power.=E2=80=
=99=20
But since today in our Republic the power lies in the hands of the=20
same men who engineered the revolution, and this revolution=20
represents the vilest high treason, nay, the most wretched piece=20
of villainy in all German history, really no reason can be found=20
for enhancing the power of these very characters by the formation=20
of a new young army. In any event, all the arguments of reason=20
speak against it.=20

But what importance this state, even after the revolution of=20
1918, attributed to the military strengthening of its position could=20
be seen clearly and unmistakably by its attitude toward the large=20
self-defense organizations that then existed. As long as they had=20
to intervene for the protection of personally cowardly creatures=20
of the revolution, they were not unwelcome. But as soon as,=20
thanks to the gradually increasing depravity of our people, the=20
danger to these creatures seemed eliminated and the existence=20
of the leagues meant a strengthening of the national-political=20
forces, they were superfluous, and everything was done to dis=C2=AC=20
arm them, in fact, if possible to break them up.=20

Only in the rarest examples does history show gratitude in=20
princes. But to count on the gratitude of revolutionary pyro-=20
maniac murderers, plunderers of the people and traitors to the=20
nation, is something that only a neo-bourgeois patriot can man=C2=AC=20
age. In any case, I, in examining the question of whether volun=C2=AC=20
teer combat leagues should be created, could never refrain from=20
the question: for whom am I training the young people? For what=20
purpose are they used and when are they to be called up? The=20
answer to this question provides at the same time the best direc=C2=AC=20
tives for our own attitude.=20

If the present state were ever to train forces of this sort, it=20
would never be for the defense of national interests against the=20
outside world, but only for the protection of the rapers of the=20
nation at home against the general rage that some day perhaps=20
will flare up in the swindled, betrayed, and sold-out people.=20


No Secret Organizations=20


543=20


For this reason alone, the SA of the NSDAP could have no=C2=AC=20
thing in common with a military organization. It was an instru=C2=AC=20
ment for defense and education in the National Socialist move=C2=AC=20
ment, and its tasks lay in an entirely different province from that=20
of the so-called combat leagues.=20

But it could also constitute no secret organization. The aim of=20
secret organizations can only be illegal. In this way the scope of=20
such an organization is automatically limited. It is not possible,=20
especially in view of the talkativeness of the German people, to=20
build up an organization of any size and at the same time to keep=20
it outwardly secret or even to veil its aims. Any such intention=20
will be thwarted a thousand times. Not only that our police=20
authorities today have a staff of pimps and similar rabble at their=20
disposal who will betray anything they can find for thirty pieces=20
of silver, and even invent things to betray, but the supporters=20
themselves can never be brought to the silence that is necessary=20
in such a case. Only very small groups, by years of sifting, can=20
assume the character of real secret organizations. But the very=20
smallness of such organizations would remove their value for the=20
National Socialist movement. What we needed and still need were=20
and are not a hundred or two hundred reckless conspirators , hut a=20
hundred thousand and a second hundred thousand fighters for our=20
philosophy of life. We should not work in secret conventicles , hut=20
in mighty mass demonstrations , and it is not hy dagger and poison=20
or pistol that the road can he cleared for the movement , hut hy the con=C2=
=AC=20
quest of the streets. We must teach the Marxists that the future mas=C2=AC=
=20
ter of the streets is National Socialism, just as it will some day he the=
=20
master of the state.=20

The danger of secret organizations today lies, furthermore, in=20
the fact that the members often totally misunderstand the mag=C2=AC=20
nitude of the task, and the opinion arises that the fate of a people=20
really might be suddenly decided in a favorable sense by a single=20
act of murder. Such an opinion can have its historical justifica=C2=AC=20
tion especially when a people languishes under the tyranny of=20
some oppressor genius, of whom it is known that his outstanding=20
personality alone guarantees the inner solidity and frightfulness=20


544=20


Mein Kampf=20


of the hostile pressure. In such a case, a self-sacrificing man may=20
suddenly spring forth from a people, to plunge the steel of death=20
into the breast of the hated individual. And only the republican=20
sentiment of petty scoundrels with a bad conscience will regard=20
such a deed as horrible, while our people's greatest poet of free=C2=AC=20
dom has dared to give a glorification of such an action in his=20
Tell=20

In the years 1919 and 1920 there existed a danger that the mem=C2=AC=20
ber of secret organizations, filled with enthusiasm by the great=20
models of history and horrified by the boundless misfortune of=20
his fatherland, should attempt to avenge himself against the de=C2=AC=20
stroyers of his homeland, in the belief that in this way he could=20
put an end to the distress of his people. Any such attempt, how=C2=AC=20
ever, was an absurdity, because Marxism had not been victorious=20
thanks to the superior genius and personal significance of an in=C2=AC=20
dividual, but by the boundless contemptibleness, the cowardly=20
failure of the bourgeois world. The most cruel criticism that can=20
be made of our bourgeoisie lies in the fact that the revolution it=C2=AC=20
self did not produce a single leader of any greatness and neverthe=C2=AC=20
less subjected it. It is understandable to capitulate to a Robes=C2=AC=20
pierre, a Danton or a Marat, but it is devastating to have crawled=20
before the scrawny Scheidemann, the fat Herr Erzberger 1 and a=20
Friedrich Ebert and all the other innumerable political midgets.=20
In reality there was not one leader who might have been regarded=20
as the genius of the revolution and hence the misfortune of the=20
fatherland; they were all revolutionary bedbugs, knapsack Spar-=20
tacists, wholesale and retail. To put any one of these out of the=20
way was completely irrelevant and the chief result was that a=20
few other bloodsuckers, just as big and just as threadbare, came=20
into a job that much sooner.=20

In those years it was not possible to attack sharply enough a=20
conception which had its cause and explanation in the really great=20

1 On Ebert and Scheidemann see page 199, note. Mattias Erzberger was=20
vice-chancellor in the cabinet of Gustav Bauer which accepted the peace=20
treaty on June 23,1919. He was murdered on August 26,1921, by two young=20
soldiers of the Ehrhardt Brigade, a Rightist military organization.=20


Should Traitors Be =E2=80=98Eliminated=E2=80=99?=20


545=20


figures of history, but was not in the least suited to the present era=20
of dwarfs.=20

Likewise, in the question of eliminating so-called traitors against=20
the nation the same consideration is in order. It is absurdly il=C2=AC=20
logical to kill a scamp who has informed about a cannon, 1 while=20
next door in the highest posts and dignities sit scoundrels who=20
have sold a whole Reich, who have the vain sacrifice of two mil=C2=AC=20
lions on their consciences, who bear the responsibility for mil=C2=AC=20
lions of cripples, and with all this calmly carry on their republican=20
business deals. It is senseless to eliminate petty traitors in a=20
country whose government itself frees these traitors against the=20
nation from any punishment. For then it is possible that some=20
day the honest idealist, who puts a scoundrelly armaments stool-=20
pigeon out of the way, for his people, is called to account by capi=C2=AC=
=20
tal traitors against the nation. Therefore, it is an important ques=C2=AC=
=20
tion : Should we have such a traitorous petty creature eliminated=20
by another creature or by an idealist? In one case the success is=20
doubtful and the treason for later almost certain; in the other=20
case, a small scoundrel is eliminated and the life of a perhaps un-=20
replaceable idealist is risked.=20

Further, in this question, my position is that there is no use in=20
hanging petty thieves in order to let big ones go free; but that=20
some day a German national court must judge and execute some=20
ten thousand of the organizing and hence responsible criminals=20
of the November betrayal and everything that goes with it.=20
Such an example will provide the small armaments stool-pigeon=20
with the necessary lesson for all time.=20

All these are considerations which caused me again and again to=20
forbid participation in secret organizations and to preserve the=20
SA itself from the character of such organizations. In those years=20
I kept the National Socialist movement away from experiments,=20
whose performers for the most part were glorious, idealistic-=20

1 At this time there were various nationalist military leagues with unof=C2=
=AC=20
ficial Reicliswehr connections, specializing in the illegal concealment of=
=20
arms. Numerous murders occurred of persons believed to have reported=20
Secret arms caches to the Allied Control Commission.=20


546=20


Mein Kampf=20


minded young Germans, whose acts, however, only made victims=20
of themselves, but were powerless to improve the lot of the=20
fatherland even in the slightest.=20

WWW=20

Now if the SA could be neither a military combat organization=20
nor a secret league, the following consequences inevitably re=C2=AC=20
sulted:=20

1. Its training must not proceed from military criteria , but from=20
criteria of expediency for the party.=20

In so far as the members require physical training, the main=20
emphasis must be laid, not on military drilling, but on athletic=20
activity. Boxing and jiu-jitsu have always seemed to me more=20
important than any inferior, because incomplete, training in=20
marksmanship. Give the German nation six million bodies with=20
flawless athletic training, all glowing with fanatical love of their=20
country and inculcated with the highest offensive spirit, and a=20
national state will, in less than two years if necessary, have=20
created an army, at least in so far as a certain basic core is pres=C2=AC=
=20
ent. This, as things are today, can rest only in the Reichswehr=20
and not in any combat league that has always done things by=20
halves. Physical culture must inoculate the individual with the=20
conviction of his superiority and give him that self-confidence=20
which lies forever and alone in the consciousness of his own=20
strength; in addition, it must give him those athletic skills which=20
serve as a weapon for the defense of the movement.=20

2. In order , at the outset , to prevent the SA from assuming any=20
secret character , in addition to its uniform immediately recognizable=20
to all , the very size of its membership must point the way which bene=C2=
=AC=20
fits the movement and is known to the whole public. It must not hold=20
sessions in secret, but must march beneath the open sky, thus=20
being put unmistakably into a type of activity which destroys=20
all legends of =E2=80=98 secret organization =E2=80=99 once and for all. An=
d in order=20
to remove it, spiritually as well, from all attempts to satisfy its=20
activism by petty conspiracies, it had from the very beginning to=20


First National Socialist March in Munich 547=20

be initiated completely into the great idea of the movement and=20
to be educated so thoroughly in the task of fighting for this idea=20
that its horizon broadened from the outset, and the individual=20
man saw his mission, not in the elimination of any greater or lesser=20
scoundrel, but in fighting for the erection of a new National=20
Socialist folkish state. Thereby the struggle against the present-=20
day state was removed from the atmosphere of petty actions of=20
revenge and conspiracy, to the greatness of a philosophical war of=20
annihilation against Marxism and its organization.=20

3. The organizational formation of the SA, as well as its uniform=20
and equipment , can therefore not reasonably emulate the models of=20
the old army , but must pursue an expediency determined by its func=C2=AC=
=20
tion .=20

These views, which directed me in 1920 and 1921 and which I=20
gradually endeavored to inject into the young organization, had=20
the result that, as early as midsummer, 1922, we disposed of an=20
imposing number of companies, which in late autumn, 1922, little=20
by little received their special distinguishing uniforms. Three=20
events were of infinite importance for the further shaping of the=20
SA.=20

1. The great general demonstration of all patriotic leagues=20
against the Lav/ for the Protection of the Republic in late summer=20
1922 on the Konigsplatz in Munich.=20

The patriotic leagues of Munich had issued an appeal summon=C2=AC=20
ing a gigantic demonstration as a protest against the introduction=20
of the Law for the Protection of the Republic. The National=20
Socialist movement was also expected to participate in it. The=20
solid procession of the party was headed by six Munich com=C2=AC=20
panies, followed by the sections of the political party. In the=20
column itself marched two brass bands, and about fifteen flags=20
were carried along. The arrival of the National Socialists in the=20
half-filled square, which was otherwise void of flags, aroused=20
immeasureable enthusiasm. I myself had the honor of being privi=C2=AC=20
leged to address the crowd, now numbering sixty thousand heads,=20
as one of the orators.=20

The success of the rally was overpowering, particularly be-=20


548=20


Mein Kampe=20


cause, in defiance of all Red threats, it was proved for the first=20
time that national Munich, too, could march in the streets.=20
Red republican defense corps ( Schutzbund ), who attempted tc=20
proceed with terror against the approaching columns, were=20
within a few minutes scattered with bloody skulls by SA detach=C2=AC=20
ments. The National Socialist movement then for the first time=20
showed its determination to claim for itself the right to the=20
streets in the future, thus wresting this monopoly from the hands=20
of the international traitors to the people and enemies of the=20
fatherland.=20

The result of this day was an incontestable proof of the psycho=C2=AC=20
logical and also organizational soundness of our conceptions with=20
regard to the structure of the SA.=20

On the foundation which had been so successfully proven, it=20
was energetically broadened, sc that only a few weeks later double=20
the number of companies had been set up.=20

2. The march to Coburg in October, 1922.=20

=E2=80=98Folkish=E2=80=99 associations planned to hold a so-called =E2=80=
=98 German=20
Day=E2=80=99 in Coburg. I myself received an invitation to it, remarking=20
that it would be desirable for me to bring an escort. This re=C2=AC=20
quest, which I received at eleven o=E2=80=99clock in the morning, came=20
very opportunely. An hour later the arrangements for attending=20
this =E2=80=98German Day=E2=80=99 had been issued. As an =E2=80=98escort=E2=
=80=99 I appointed=20
eight hundred men of the SA; we arranged to transport them in=20
approximately fourteen companies by special train to the little=20
city that had become Bavarian. 1 Similar orders went out to Na=C2=AC=20
tional Socialist SA groups which had meanwhile been formed in=20
other places.=20

It was the first time that such a special train was used in Ger=C2=AC=20
many. At all towns where new SA men got in, the transport=20
aroused much attention. Many people had never seen our flags=20
before; the impression they made was very great.=20

When we arrived at the Coburg station, we were received by a=20
deputation of the organizers of the =E2=80=98 German Day,=E2=80=99 which co=
n-=20

1 Coburg, former co-capital of the Duchy of Saxony-Coburg-Gotha, was a=20
Eeparate administrative entity up to 1920 when it became part of Bavaria.=
=20


The March to Coburg=20


549=20


yeyed to us an order from the local trade unions =E2=80=94 in other=20
words, from the Independent 1 and Communist Party =E2=80=94 to the=20
effect that we were forbidden to enter the town with flags un=C2=AC=20
furled, or with music (we had taken along a forty-two-piece=20
band of our own), or to march in a solid column.=20

I at once flatly rejected these disgraceful conditions, and did=20
not fail to express to the gentlemen present, the organizers of this=20
congress, my surprise that they had carried on negotiations with=20
these people and entered into agreements; I declared that the SA=20
would immediately line up in companies and march into the city=20
with resounding music and flags flying.=20

And that is just what happened.=20

On the square in front of the railroad station we were received=20
by a howling, shrieking mob numbering thousands. =E2=80=98Murder=C2=AC=20
ers/ =E2=80=98bandits/ =E2=80=98robbers/ =E2=80=98criminals/ were the pet n=
ames which=20
the model founders of the German Republic affectionately show=C2=AC=20
ered on us. The young SA kept exemplary order, the companies=20
formed on the square in front of the station, and at first took no=20
notice of the vulgar abuse. In the city that was strange to all of=20
us, frightened police officials led the marching column, not, as=20
arranged, to our quarters, a shooting gallery situated on the=20
periphery of Coburg, but to the Hofbrauhauskeller, near the cen=C2=AC=20
ter of the city. To left and right of the procession, the uproar of=20
the masses of people accompanying us increased more and more.=20
Hardly had the last company turned into the courtyard of the=20
Keller than great masses, amid deafening cries, tried to crowd in=20
after us. To prevent this, the police locked the Keller. Since this=20
state of affairs was intolerable, I had the SA line up once again,=20
gave them a brief speech of admonition, and demanded that the=20
police open the gates immediately. After a long hesitation, they=20
yielded.=20

To get to our quarters, we marched back the way we had come,=20
and now at last a stand had to be taken. After they had been=20
unable to disturb the poise of our companies by cries and insulting=20
shouts, the representatives of true socialism, equality, and fra-=20

1 Sei* cage 369, note.=20


550=20


Mein Kampf=20


ternity had recourse to stones. At this our patience was at an=20
end, and so for ten whole minutes a devastating hail fell from=20
left and right, and a quarter of an hour later, there was nothing=20
red to be seen in the streets.=20

In the evening there were serious clashes again. Some National=20
Socialists had been assaulted singly, and patrols of the SA found=20
them in a terrible condition. Thereupon we made short shrift of=20
our foes. By next morning the Red terror, under which Coburg=20
had suffered for years, had been broken.=20

With real Marxist-Jewish lies they now attempted to harry the=20
=E2=80=98 comrades of the international proletariat =E2=80=99 back into the=
 streets,=20
by totally twisting the facts and maintaining that our =E2=80=98 bands of=
=20
murderers=E2=80=99 had begun a =E2=80=98war of extermination against peacef=
ul=20
workers=E2=80=99 in Coburg. The great =E2=80=98demonstration of the people,=
=E2=80=99=20
which, it was hoped, tens of thousands of workers from the whole=20
vicinity would attend, was set for half-past one. Therefore,=20
firmly resolved to dispose of the Red terror for good, I ordered=20
the SA, which had meanwhile swollen to nearly one and a half=20
thousand men, to line up, and set out with them on the march=20
for the Fortress of Coburg, by way of the great square on which=20
the Red demonstration was to take place. I wanted to see whether=20
they would dare to molest us again. When we entered the square,=20
only a few hundred were present instead of the announced ten.=20
thousand, and at our approach they kept generally quiet, and=20
some ran away. Only at a few points did Red troops, who had=20
meanwhile come from the outside and who did not yet know us,=20
try to pester us again; but in the twinkling of an eye, all their=20
enthusiasm was spoiled. And now it could be seen how the=20
frightened and intimidated population slowly woke up and took=20
courage, and ventured to shout greetings at us, and in the evening=20
as we were marching off broke into spontaneous cheering in many=20
places.=20

At the station the railroad men suddenly informed us that they=20
would not run the train. Thereupon I notified a few of the ring=C2=AC=20
leaders that in that case I planned to round up whatever Red=20
bosses fell into my hands, and that we would run the train our-=20


1=20


The SA Proves Itself=20


551=20


selves; however, we would take along a few dozen of the brothers=20
of international solidarity on the locomotive and the tender and=20
in every car. Nor did I fail to call it to the gentlemen=E2=80=99s attentio=
n=20
that the trip with our own forces would, of course, be an extremely=20
risky undertaking and that it was not excluded that the whole=20
lot of us should break our necks and bones. But, anyway, in=20
that case, we should be delighted to leave for the Hereafter, not=20
alone but in equality and fraternity with the Red gentlemen.=20

Thereupon the train departed with the utmost punctuality,=20
and we were back in Munich safe and sound the following morn-=20
ing.=20

Thus, for the first time since 1914 the equality of citizens be=C2=AC=20
fore the law was re-established in Coburg. For if today some=20
simpleton of a higher official ventures the assertion that the state=20
protects the lives of its citizens, this was certainly not the case=20
at that time; for at that time the citizens had to defend them=C2=AC=20
selves against the representatives of the present-day state.=20

At first the importance of this day could not be fully evaluated=20
by its consequences. Not only that the victorious SA had been=20
enormously enhanced in its self-confidence and its faith in the=20
soundness of its leadership, but the outside w T orld also began to=20
follow our doings more closely, and many for the first time recog=C2=AC=20
nized in the National Socialist movement the institution which=20
in all probability would some day be called upon to put a suitable=20
end to the Marxist madness.=20

Only the democrats groaned that anyone could dare not peace=C2=AC=20
fully to let his skull be bashed in, and that under a=E2=80=98democratic=20
republic we had had the audacity to oppose a brutal attack with=20
fists and cudgels instead of pacifistic songs.=20

On the whole, the bourgeois press, as usual, was partly pitiful=20
and partly contemptible, and only a few honest newspapers=20
greeted the fact that in one place at least someone had dared to=20
call a halt to the activity of the Marxist highwaymen.=20

In Coburg itself, at least a part of the Marxist working class,=20
which incidentally could be regarded only as misled, had learned=20
a lesson from the fists of National Socialist labor and been taught=20


552=20


Mein Kampf=20


to realize that these workers also fight for ideals, since, as ex=C2=AC=20
perience shows, men fight only for something that they believe=20
in and love.=20

The greatest benefit, however, was derived by the SA itself.=20
It now grew with great rapidity, and at the Party Day held on=20
January 27, 1923, approximately six thousand men could take=20
part in the dedication of the flag, and the first companies were=20
fully equipped with their new uniforms.=20

For the experience in Coburg had shown how necessary it is,=20
and not only in order to strengthen the esprit de corps, but also to=20
avoid confusion and forestall mutual non-recognition, to introduce=20
uniform dress among the SA. Until then it wore only the arm-=20
band; now the canvas jacket and the well-known cap were added.=20

And, furthermore, the experience of Coburg had the signifi=C2=AC=20
cance that we now began systematically, in all places where for=20
many years the Red terror had prevented any meeting of people=20
with different ideas, to break this terror and restore freedom of as=C2=AC=
=20
sembly. From now on, National Socialist battalions were as=C2=AC=20
sembled again and again in such localities, and in Bavaria gradu=C2=AC=20
ally one Red citadel after another fell a victim to National Social=C2=AC=
=20
ist propaganda. The SA had grown more and more into its task,=20
and so had moved further and further away from the character=20
of a senseless and unimportant defense movement and risen to=20
the level of a living organization of struggle for the erection of a=20
new German state.=20

This logical development lasted until March, 1923. Then there=20
occurred an event which compelled me to shift the movement=20
from its previous course and subject it to a modification.=20

3. The occupation of the Ruhr by the French in the first months=20
of 1923 had in the following period a great significance for the=20
development of the SA.=20

Even today it is not yet possible, and particularly in the na=C2=AC=20
tional interest not expedient, to speak or write of this with full=20
publicity. I can only express myself in so far as this theme has=20
already been touched upon in public proceedings and thus brought=20
to the knowledge of the public.=20


Autumn 1923=20


553=20


The occupation of the Ruhr, which came as no surprise to us,=20
gave rise to the justified hope that now at length there would be=20
an end to the cowardly policy of retreat, and that with this a=20
definite task would fall to the combat leagues. And the SA, which=20
then embraced many thousands of young powerful men, could not=20
fittingly be excluded from this national service. In the spring=20
and midsummer of 1923 it was reshaped into a military fighting=20
organization. To it the later development of 1923, in so far as it=20
concerned our movement, was attributable.=20

Since I treat the development of 1923 in broad outlines else=C2=AC=20
where, I shall only state here that the reorientation of the SA=20
was a harmful one from the viewpoint of the movement, if the=20
presuppositions that had led to its reorientation =E2=80=94 that is, the=20
resumption of active resistance against France =E2=80=94 did not ma=C2=AC=
=20
terialize.=20

The close of the year 1923, terrible as it may seem at first=20
sight, may, if viewed from a higher standpoint, be regarded as=20
positively necessary, in so far as with one stroke it ended the re=C2=AC=20
orientation of the SA, made pointless by the attitude of the Ger=C2=AC=20
man Reich government and hence harmful for the movement, and=20
thus created the possibility of building some day at the point=20
where we had once been forced to relinquish the correct road.=20

The NSDAP, newly founded in 1925, must again set up, train,=20
and organize its SA according to the aforementioned principles.=20
It must thus return to the original healthy views, and must now=20
once more find its highest task in creating, in its SA, an instru=C2=AC=20
ment for the conduct and reinforcement of the movement=E2=80=99s=20
struggle for its philosophy of life.=20

It must neither suffer the SA to degenerate into a kind of com=C2=AC=20
bat league nor into a secret organization; it must, on the con=C2=AC=20
trary, endeavor to train it as a guard, numbering hundreds of=20
thousands of men, for the National Socialist and hence profoundly=20
folkish idea.=20


CHAPTER=20

X=20


Federalism as a Mask=20


I=20

JLn the winter of 1919, and even more in=20
the spring and summer of 1920, the young party was forced to=20
take a position on a question which even during the War rose to=20
an immense importance. In the first volume, in my brief account=20
of the symptoms of the threatening German collapse that were=20
visible to me personally, I have pointed to the special type of=20
propaganda which was carried on by the English as well as the=20
French for the purpose of tearing open the old cleft between=20
North and South. In spring, 1915, there appeared the first syste=C2=AC=20
matic agitational leaflets attacking Prussia, as solely responsible=20
for the War. By 1916, this system had been brought to full per=C2=AC=20
fection, as adroit as it was treacherous. And after a short time=20
the agitation of the South German against the North German,=20
calculated on the lowest instincts, began to bear fruit. It is a re=C2=AC=
=20
proach that must be raised against the authorities of that time,=20
in the government as well as the army command =E2=80=94 or rather the=20
Bavarian staff offices =E2=80=94 a reproach which these last cannot shake=
=20
off, that in their damnable blindness and disregard of duty they=20
did not proceed against this with the necessary determination.=20
Nothing was done! On the contrary, various quarters did not=20
seem to take it so much amiss, and they were small-minded=20
enough to believe that such a propaganda would not only put a=20
bar in the path of the development of the German people toward=20
Unity, but that it would inevitably and automatically bring a=20


War Societies and Anti-Prussian Sentiment 555=20

strengthening of the federative forces. Scarcely ever in history=20
has a mahcious omission brought more evil consequences. The=20
weakening these men thought they were administering to Prussia=20
struck the whole of Germany. And its consequence was the ac=C2=AC=20
celeration of the collapse, which, however, not only shattered=20
Germany herself, but primarily, in point of fact, the individual=20
states themselves.=20

In the city where the artificially fanned hatred against Prussia=20
raged most violently, the revolution was first to break out against=20
the hereditary royal house.=20

Yet it would be false to believe that the manufacture of this=20
anti-Prussian mood is attributable solely to hostile war propa=C2=AC=20
ganda and that the people affected by it had no grounds of justi=C2=AC=20
fication. The incredible way in which our war economy was=20
organized, a positively insane centralization that held the whole=20
German Reich territory in tutelage and pillaged it to the limit,=20
was one of the main reasons for the rise of this anti-Prussian=20
sentiment. For the average little man, the war societies, 1 which hap=C2=AC=
=20
pened to have their central offices in Berlin, and Berlin itself, were=20
synonymous with Prussia . It scarcely dawned on the individual=20
at that time that the organizers of this institute of robbery, known=20
as =E2=80=98war societies/ were neither Berliners nor Prussians, in fact,=
=20
were not Germans at all. He saw only the great faults and the=20
constant encroachments of this hated institution in the capital=20
and then naturally transferred his whole hatred to the capital and=20
Prussia simultaneously, all the more so since in certain quarters=20
not only nothing was done about this, but such an interpretation=20
was even secretly and smirkingly welcomed.=20

The Jew was far too shrewd not to realize in those days that the=20
infamous campaign of pillage that he was then organizing against=20
the German people, under the cloak of the war societies, would,=20
nay, must, arouse resistance. But as long as it did not spring at=20

1 Kriegsgesellschaften. These were the corporations, with state participa=
=C2=AC=20
tion and control, established in 1914 to carry on war production. For some=
=20
months at the beginning of the War, Walter Rathenau, a lew, headed the raw=
=20
material department of the Prussian war ministry.=20


556=20


Mein Kampe=20


his own throat, he had no need to fear it. But in order to prevent=20
an explosion of the masses driven to despair and indignation in=20
this direction, there could be no better prescription than to cause=20
their rage to flare up elsewhere, thus using it up.=20

Let Bavaria fight against Prussia and Prussia against Bavaria=20
as much as they wanted, the more the better! The hottest strug=C2=AC=20
gle between the two meant the securest peace for the Jew. In this=20
way, the general attention was entirely diverted from the inter=C2=AC=20
national maggot of nations. And if the danger seemed to arise=20
that thoughtful elements, of which there were many in Bavaria,=20
as elsewhere, called for understanding, reflection, and restraint=20
and so the embittered struggle threatened to die down, the Jew=20
in Berlin needed only to stage a new provocation and wait for the=20
result. Instantly all the beneficiaries of the conflict between=20
North and South flung themselves on every such occurrence, and=20
kept on blowing until the flame of indignation had again burst=20
into a roaring blaze.=20

It was an adroit, subtle game that the Jew then played, con=C2=AC=20
stantly occupying and distracting the individual German tribes,=20
and meanwhile pillaging them the more thoroughly.=20

Then came the revolution.=20

If up to the year 1918, or rather up to November of this year,=20
the average man, and especially the little-educated petit bour=C2=AC=20
geois and worker, especially in Bavaria, could not yet correctly=20
estimate the real course and the inevitable consequences of the=20
quarrel of German tribes among themselves, the section calling=20
themselves =E2=80=98 national =E2=80=99 should at least have had to recogni=
ze it on=20
the day of the outbreak of the revolution. For no sooner had the=20
action succeeded than in Bavaria the leader and organizer of the=20
revolution became the defender of =E2=80=98 Bavarian J interests. The=20
international Jew Kurt Eisner began to play Bavaria against=20
Prussia . It goes without saying, however, that this Oriental=20
who spent his time as a newspaper journaille 1 running all over=20

1 Journaille is a brunch word composed of =E2=80=98journal=E2=80=99 and =E2=
=80=98 canaille,=E2=80=99 at=C2=AC=20
tributed to Karl Kraus, editor and writer of the Viennese magazine =E2=80=
=98Die=20
Packet.=E2=80=99 Zeitungsjournaille is a typical Hitlerian redundancy.=20


Kurt Eisner, the =E2=80=98Bavarian Particularist 9 557=20

Germany, was unquestionably the last man fitted to defend=20
Bavarian interests, and that to him, in particular, Bavaria was=20
a matter of the utmost indifference possible on God=E2=80=99s earth.=20

In giving the revolutionary uprising in Bavaria a thoroughly con=C2=AC=20
scious edge against the rest of the Reich, Kurt Eisner did not in the=20
least act from Bavarian motives, hut solely as the servant of the Jews.=20
He used the existing instincts and dislikes of the Bavarian people,=20
to help him break up Germany the more easily. The shattered=20
Reich would have easily fallen a prey to Bolshevism.=20

After his death the tactics applied by him were at first con=C2=AC=20
tinued. The Marxists, who had always covered the individual=20
states and their princes in Germany with the bloodiest scorn,=20
now came out as an =E2=80=98Independent Party 5 and suddenly appealed=20
to those feelings and instincts which had their strongest roots in=20
princely houses and individual states.=20

The fight of the Bavarian Republic of Councils 1 against the=20
approaching contingents of liberation was dressed up by propa=C2=AC=20
ganda as mainly a =E2=80=98struggle of the Bavarian workers=E2=80=99 agains=
t=20
=E2=80=98Prussian militarism.=E2=80=99 Only from this can it be understood =
why=20
in Munich, quite unlike the other German territories, the over=C2=AC=20
throw of the Republic of Councils did not bring the great masses=20
to their senses, but rather led to an even greater bitterness and=20
rancor against Prussia.=20

The skill with which the Bolshevistic agitators were able to=20
represent the elimination of the Republic of Councils as a =E2=80=98 Prus=
=C2=AC=20
sian militaristic =E2=80=99 victory against the =E2=80=98 anti-militaristic=
 =E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98 anti-=20
Prussian=E2=80=99 Bavarian people, bore rich fruit. While Kurt Eisner, on=
=20
the occasion of the elections to the legislative Bavarian Provincial=20
Diet in Munich, still could summon not even ten thousand sup-=20

1 After the murder of Kurt Eisner there was at first a Majority Socialist=
=20
government under Hoffmann. On April 7, the Workers=E2=80=99 Councils procla=
imed=20
the Republic of Councils. A temporary council was formed of Independents=20
and the Bavarian Peasant League (Bauernbund ). On April 10, this was=20
overthrown by the Communists, partly under Russian leadership. Free=20
corps from surrounding states marched on Munich and occupied it on May 1,=

porters, and the Communist Party actually remained under three=20
thousand, after the collapse of the Republic both parties together=20
had risen to nearly a hundred thousand voters.=20

As early as this period my personal fight against the insane=20
incitement of German tribes against each other began.=20

I believe that in all my life I have undertaken no more unpopu=C2=AC=20
lar cause than my resistance at that time to the anti-Prussian=20
agitation . In Munich, even during the Soviet period, the first=20
mass meetings had taken place, in which hatred against the rest=20
of Germany and in particular against Prussia was lashed to such=20
a white heat that it not only involved a risk of his life for a North=20

You need to have lived through the meetings of that time to=20
understand what it meant for me when, surrounded by a handful=20
of friends, I for the first time, at a meeting in the Lowenbraukeller=20
in Munich, offered resistance against this madness. It was wai=20
comrades who then supported me, and perhaps you can imagine=20
how we felt when a mob =E2=80=94 by far the greatest part of which had=20
been deserters and slackers, hanging around the reserve posts or=20
at home while we were defending the fatherland =E2=80=94 lost all reason=20
and bellowed at us and threatened to strike us down. For me,=20
to be sure, these incidents had the virtue that the squad of my=20
loyal followers came to feel really attached to me, and was soon=20
sworn to live or die by my side.=20

These struggles, which were repeated again and again and=20
dragged out through the entire year of 1919, seemed to become=20
even sharper right at the beginning of 1920. There were meetings=20
=E2=80=94 I particularly remember one in the Wagner-Saal in the Sonnen-=20
Strasse in Munich =E2=80=94 in which my group, which had meanwhile=20
grown stronger, had to withstand grave clashes, which not seldom=20
ended in dozens of my supporters being mishandled, struck down,=20


=E2=80=98Federative=E2=80=99 Activity=20


559=20


trampled under foot, and finally, more dead than alive, thrown=20
out of the nails.=20

The struggle which I had first taken up as an individual, sup=C2=AC=20
ported only by my war comrades, was now continued by the=20
young movement as, I might also say, a sacred mission.=20

Today I am still proud to be able to say that in those days =E2=80=94=20
dependent almost entirely on our Bavarian adherents =E2=80=94 we=20
nevertheless slowly but surely put an end to this mixture of=20
stupidity and treason. I say stupidity and treason because,=20
though fully convinced that the mass of followers were really=20
nothing but good-natured fools, such simplicity cannot be at=C2=AC=20
tributed to the organizers and instigators. I regarded them, and=20
today still regard them, as traitors bought and paid for by France.=20
In one case, the Dorten case, 1 history has already given its verdict.=20

What made the affair especially dangerous at that time was the=20
skill with which the true tendencies were concealed, by shoving=20
federalistic intentions into the foreground as the sole motive for=20
this activity. But it is obvious that stirring up hatred against=20
Prussia has nothing to do with federalism. And a =E2=80=98federative=20
activity * which attempts to dissolve or split up another federal=20
state makes a weird impression. An honorable federalist, for=20
whom quotations of Bismarck=E2=80=99s conception of the Reich are more=20
than lying phrases, would hardly in the same breath want to=20
separate portions from the Prussian state created or rather com=C2=AC=20
pleted by Bismarck, let alone publicly support such separatist=20
endeavors. How they would have yelled in Munich if a con=C2=AC=20
servative Prussian party had favored the separation of Franconia=20
from Bavaria, or actually demanded and promoted it by public=20
action. In all this one could only feel sorry for the honest, federal=C2=AC=
=20
ist-minded souls who had not seen through this foul swindle; for=20
they, first and foremost, were the cheated parties. By thus com=C2=AC=20
promising the federative idea, its ow r n supporters were digging its=20
grave. It is impossible to preach a federalistic form for the Reich,=20

1 Dorten was state=E2=80=99s attorney in Wiesbaden after the World War. In =
1919=20
he tried to establish a Rhenish Republic in collaboration with the French.=

at the same time deprecating, reviling, and befouling the most es=C2=AC=20
sential section of such a state structure, namely, Prussia, and in=20
short, making it, if possible, impossible as a federal state. 1 What=20
made this all the more incredible was that the fight of these so-=20
called federalists was directed precisely against that Prussia=20
which can least be brought into connection with the November=20
democracy. For it was not against the fathers of the Weimar Con=C2=AC=20
stitution , who themselves incidentally were for the most part=20
South Germans or Jews, that the vilifications and attacks of these=20
so-called =E2=80=98federalists=E2=80=99 were directed, but against the repr=
esenta=C2=AC=20
tives of the old conservative Prussia , hence the antipodes of the=20
Weimar Constitution. It must not surprise us that they took=20
special care not to attack the Jew, and perhaps this furnishes the=20
key to the solution of the whole riddle.=20

Just as before the revolution the Jew knew how to divert at=C2=AC=20
tention from his war societies, or rather from himself, and was=20
able to turn the masses, especially of the Bavarian people, against=20
Prussia, after the revolution he had somehow to cover his new=20
and ten times bigger campaign of pillage. And again he suc=C2=AC=20
ceeded, in this case in inciting the so-called =E2=80=98 national elements =
=E2=80=99 of=20
Germany against one another: conservative-minded Bavaria against=20
equally conservative-thinking Prussia. And again he managed it=20
in the shrewdest way; he, who alone held the strings of the=20
Reich=E2=80=99s destinies, provoked such brutal and tactless excesses that=
=20
the blood of those affected could not but be brought to the boil=C2=AC=20
ing point each time anew. Yet never against the Jew, but always=20
against the German brother. It was not the Berlin of four million=20
hard-working, producing people that the Bavarian saw, but the=20
rotten decaying Berlin of the foulest West End! But it was not=20
against this West End that his hatred turned, but against the 1 Prus=C2=AC=

Often it could really drive you to despair.=20

This aptitude of the Jew for diverting public attention from=20
himself and occupying it elsewhere, can be studied again today.=20

In 1918 there could be no question of a systematic anti-=20

Semitism. I still remember the difficulties one encountered if=20
one so much as uttered the word Jew. Either one was stupidly=20
gaped at, or one experienced the most violent resistance. Our=20
first attempts to show the public the real enemy then seemed al=C2=AC=20
most hopeless, and only very slowly did things begin to take a=20
better turn. Bad as the organizational set-up of the Watch and=20
Ward League (Schulz- und Trutzbund) 1 was, it nonetheless had=20
great merit in having reopened the Jewish question as such. At all=20
events, in the winter of 1918-19, something like anti-Semitism=20
began slowly to take root. Later, to be sure, the National Socialist=20
movement drove the Jewish question to the fore in quite a dif=C2=AC=20
ferent way. 1 2 Above all, it succeeded in lifting this problem out of=20
the narrow, limited circle of bourgeois and petit bourgeois strata=20
and transforming it into the driving impulse of a great people=E2=80=99s=20
movement. But scarcely had it succeeded in giving the German=20
people its great, unifying idea of struggle in this question than=20
the Jew commenced to counter-attack. He seized upon his old=20
weapon. With miraculous speed he threw the torch of discord=20
into the folkish movement and sowed dissension. As things then=20
stood, the only possibility of occupying the public attention with=20
other questions and withholding a concentrated attack from the=20
Jews lay in raising the Ultramontane question , and in the resulting=20
clash between Catholicism and Protestantism. These men can=20
never atone for the wrong they did our people in hurling this=20
question into their midst. In any case the Jew reached his de=C2=AC=20
sired goal: Catholics and Protestants wage a merry war with one=20
another, and the mortal enemy of Aryan humanity and all Chris=C2=AC=20
tendom laughs up his sleeve.=20

anti-Semitic organization, founded in 1919, ostensibly to protect German=20
culture against Jewish influence, though anti-Semitism was not officially=

mentioned in its program. Its propaganda was first directed against the Jew=
=C2=AC=20
ish immigrants from Russia and Poland after the war. It petered out in=20
1922, its members merging with the National Socialists. It introduced the=

Just as formerly they were able to busy public opinion for=20
years with the struggle between federalism and centralization,=20
thus wearing it down with exhaustion, while the Jew sold the=20
freedom of the nation and betrayed our fatherland to interna=C2=AC=20
tional high finance, now again he succeeds in causing the two=20
German denominations to assail one another, while the founda=C2=AC=20
tions of both are corroded and undermined by the poison of the=20
international world Jew.=20

Bear in mind the devastations which Jewish bastardization=20
visits on our nation each day, and consider that this blood=20
poisoning can be removed from our national body only after=20
centuries, if at all; consider further how racial disintegration=20
drags down and often destroys the last Aryan values of our=20
German people, so that our strength as a culture-bearing na=C2=AC=20
tion is visibly more and more involved in a regression and we=20
run the risk, in our big cities at least, of reaching the point where=20
southern Italy is today. This contamination of our blood,=20
blindly ignored by hundreds of thousands of our people, is carried=20
on systematically by the Jew today. Systematically these black=20
parasites of the nation defile our inexperienced young blond girls=20
and thereby destroy something which can no longer be replaced=20
in this world. Both, yes, both Christian denominations look on=20
indifferently at this desecration and destruction of a noble and=20
unique living creature, given to the earth by God=E2=80=99s grace. The=20
significance of this for the future of the earth does not lie in=20
whether the Protestants defeat the Catholics or the Catholics the=20
Protestants, but in whether the Aryan man is preserved for the=20
earth or dies out. Nevertheless, the two denominations do not=20
fight today against the destroyer of this man, but strive mutually=20
to annihilate one another. The folkish-minded man, in particu=C2=AC=20
lar, has the sacred duty, each in his own denomination, of mak=C2=AC=20
ing people stop just talking superjicially of God=E2=80=99s will, and actu=
=C2=AC=20
ally fulfill God's will, and not let God=E2=80=99s word be desecrated.=20

For God=E2=80=99s will gave men their form, their essence and their=20
abilities. Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the=20
Lord=E2=80=99s creation, the divine will. Therefore, let every man be=20


Denominational Disputes=20


563=20


active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every=20
man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone=20
who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of=20
his religious community and tries to butt into the other. For in=20
Germany to attack the special characteristics of a denomination,=20
within the religious schism we already have with us, necessarily=20
leads to a war of annihilation between the two denominations.=20
Our conditions permit here of no comparison say with France or=20
Spain, let alone Italy. In all three countries, for example, a fight=20
can be preached against clericalism or Ultramontanism, without=20
running the risk that in this endeavor the French, Spanish, or=20
Italian people as such will fall apart. In Germany, however, this=20
may not be done, for here it is certain that the Protestants would=20
also participate in such a movement. And thus the resistance,=20
which would elsewhere be carried on only by Catholics against=20
encroachments of a political nature by their own high clergy,=20
immediately assumes the character of an attack of Protestantism=20
against Catholicism . What is tolerated from members of the same=20
denomination, even when it is unjust, is at once sharply rejected=20
at the outset, as soon as the assailant belongs to another creed.=20
This goes so far that even men, who themselves would be perfectly=20
willing to correct a visible abuse within their own religious com=C2=AC=20
munity, at once change their minds and turn their resistance out=C2=AC=20
ward as soon as such a correction is recommended, let alone de=C2=AC=20
manded, by a source not belonging to their community. They=20
regard this as an unjustified and impermissible, nay, indecent at=C2=AC=20
tempt to mix in matters which do not concern the party in ques=C2=AC=20
tion. Such attempts are not pardoned even if they are justified=20
by the higher right of the interests of the national community,=20
since today religious sentiments still go deeper than all considera=C2=AC=
=20
tions of national and political expediency. And this is in no way=20
changed by driving the two denominations into an embittered=20
mutual war, but could only change if, through compatibility on=20
both sides, the nation is given a future which by its greatness=20
would gradually have a conciliatory effect in this province as=20
elsewhere.=20


564=20


Mein Kampf=20


I do not hesitate to declare that I regard the men who today=20
draw the folkish movement into the crisis of religious quarrels as=20
worse enemies of my people than any international Communist.=20
For to convert the latter is the mission of the National Socialist=20
movement. But anyone in its own ranks who leads it away from=20
its true mission is acting damnably. Whether consciously or un=C2=AC=20
consciously is immaterial, he is a fighter for Jewish interests. For=20
it is to the Jewish interest today to make the folkish movement=20
bleed to death in a religious struggle at the moment when it is=20
beginning to become a danger for the Jew. And I expressly em=C2=AC=20
phasize the words bleed to death; for only a man without histori=C2=AC=20
cal education can imagine that with this movement today a prob=C2=AC=20
lem can be solved which has defied centuries and great states=C2=AC=20
men.=20

For the rest, the facts speak for themselves. The gentlemen=20
who in 1924 suddenly discovered that the highest mission of the=20
folkish movement was the struggle against * Ultramontanism =E2=80=99 did=20
not break Ultramontanism, but tore apart the folkish movement. 1=20
I must also lodge protest against any immature mind in the ranks=20
of the folkish movement imagining that he can do what even a=20
Bismarck could not do. It will always be the highest duty of the=20
top leadership of the National Socialist movement to offer the=20
sharpest opposition to any attempt to drive the National Socialist=20
movement into such struggles, and immediately to remove the=20
propagandists of such an intention from the ranks of the move=C2=AC=20
ment. And actually, by autumn, 1923, we succeeded entirely in=20
this. In the ranks of the movement, the most devout Protestant=20
could sit beside the most devout Catholic , without coming into the=20
slightest conflict with his religious convictions. The mighty=20
common struggle which both carried on against the destroyer of=20
Aryan humanity had, on the contrary, taught them mutually to=20
respect and esteem one another. And yet, in these very years, the=20
movement carried on the bitterest fight against the Center,=20
though never on religious, but exclusively on national, racial, and=20

Notional Socialism after the putsch of November, 1923.=20


Federation or Unified State?=20


565=20


economico-political grounds. The results spoke in our favor, just=20
as today they testify against the know-it-alls.=20

In recent years things have sometimes gone so far that folkish=20
circles in the God-forsaken blindness of their denominational=20
squabbles did not even recognize the madness of their actions=20
from the fact that atheistic Marxist newspapers suddenly, when=20
convenient, became advocates of religious communities, and tried=20
to compromise one or the other by bandying back and forth re=C2=AC=20
marks that were sometimes really too stupid, and thus stir up the=20
fire to the extreme.=20

Especially with a people like the Germans, who have so often=20
demonstrated in their history that they were capable of waging=20
wars down to the last drop of blood for phantoms, any such battle-=20
cry will be mortally dangerous. In this way our people has=20
always been diverted from the real practical questions of its=20
existence. While we devoured each other in religious squabbles,=20
the rest of the world was distributed. And while the folkish=20
movement considers whether the Ultramontane peril is greater=20
than the Jewish peril or vice versa, the Jew destroys the racial=20
foundations of our existence and thus destroys our people for all=20
time. As far as this variety of =E2=80=98 folkish=E2=80=99 warriors are con=
cerned,=20
I can only wish the National Socialist movement and the German=20
people with all my heart: Lord, protect them from such friends=20
and they will settle with their enemies by themselves.=20

The struggle between federalism and centralization so shrewdly=20
propagated by the Jews in 1919-20-21 and afterward, forced the=20
National Socialist movement, though absolutely rejecting it, to=20
take a position on its essential problems.=20

Should Germany be a federated or a unified state , and what for=20
practical purposes must be understood by the two? To me the=20
second seems the more important question, because it is not only=20
fundamental to the understanding of the whole problem, but also=20


566=20


Mein Kampf=20


because it is clarifying and possesses a conciliatory character.=20

What is a federated state?=20

By a federated state we understand a league of sovereign states=20
which band together of their own free will, on the strength of their=20
sovereignty; ceding to the totality that share of their particular=20
sovereign rights which makes possible and guarantees the exist=C2=AC=20
ence of the common federation.=20

In practice this theoretical formulation does not apply entirely=20
to any of the federated states existing on earth today. Least of all=20
to the American Union, where, as far as the overwhelming part=20
of the individual states are concerned, there can be no question of=20
any original sovereignty, but, on the contrary, many of them were=20
sketched into the total area of the Union in the course of time, so=20
to speak. Hence in the individual states of the American Union=20
we have mostly to do with smaller and larger territories, formed=20
for technical, administrative reasons, and, often marked out with=20
a ruler, states which previously had not and could not have pos=C2=AC=20
sessed any state sovereignty of their own. For it was not these=20
states that had formed the Union, on the contrary it was the=20
Union which formed a great part of such so-called states. The=20
very extensive special rights granted, or rather assigned, to the=20
individual territories are not only in keeping with the whole=20
character of this federation of states, but above all with the size of=20
its area, its spatial dimensions which approach the scope of a=20
continent. And so, as far as the states of the American Union are=20
concerned, we cannot speak of their state sovereignty, but only of=20
their constitutionally established and guaranteed rights, or better,=20
perhaps, privileges.=20

The above formulation is not fully and entirely applicable to=20
Germany either. Although in Germany without doubt the=20
individual states did exist first and in the form of states, and the=20
Reich was formed out of them. But the very formation of the=20
Reich did not take place on the basis of the free will or equal par=C2=AC=
=20
ticipation of the single states, but through the workings of the=20
hegemony of one state among them, Prussia. The great difference=20
between the German states, from the purely territorial stand-=20


Federation or Unified State?=20


567=20


point, permits no comparison with the formation of the American=20
Union, for instance. The difference in size between the smallest of=20
the former federated states and the larger ones, let alone the=20
largest, shows the non-similarity of their achievements, and also=20
the inequality of their share in the founding of the Reich, the=20
forming of the federated state. Actually, in most of these states=20
there could be no question of a real sovereignty, except if state=20
sovereignty was taken only as an official phrase. In reality, not=20
only the past, but the present as well, had put an end to any=20
number of these so-called =E2=80=98 sovereign states =E2=80=99 and thus cle=
arly=20
demonstrated the weakness of these =E2=80=98 sovereign =E2=80=99 formations=
.=20

I shall not state here how each of these states was historically=20
formed, but I do want to say that in practically no case do they=20
coincide with tribal boundaries. They are purely political=20
phenomena, and their roots for the most part go back to the=20
gloomiest epoch of the German Reich's impotence and of the=20
national fragmentation which conditioned it and itself in turn=20
was conditioned by it.=20

All this, in part at least, was taken into account by the consti=C2=AC=20
tution of the old Reich, in so far as it did not grant the individual=20
states the same representation in the Bundesrat, 1 but set up grada=C2=AC=
=20
tions corresponding to size and actual importance, as well as the=20
achievement of the individual states in the formation of the Reich.=20

The sovereign rights waived by the single states to make pos=C2=AC=20
sible the formation of the Reich were only in the smallest part=20
surrendered of their own free will; in the greatest part they were=20
either practically non-existent to begin with or were simply taken=20
away under the pressure of superior Prussian power. At the same=20
time, Bismarck did not act on the principle of giving to the Reich=20
everything that could in any way be taken away from the individ=C2=AC=20
ual states; his principle was to demand of the individual states=20
only what the Reich absolutely needed. A principle as moderate=20

=20
tion formed in 1867, and later of the German Empire. Made up of delegates=
=20

was a sort of upper house.=20


568=20


Mein Kampf=20


as it was wise, which on the one hand took the highest considera=C2=AC=20
tion of custom and tradition, and on the other hand thereby=20
assured the new Reich a great measure of love and joyful collabo=C2=AC=20
ration at the very outset. It is absolutely wrong, however, to at=C2=AC=20
tribute this decision of Bismarck to his conviction that the Reich=20
thus possessed sufficient sovereign rights for all time. Bismarck=20
had no such conviction; on the contrary, he only wanted to put=20
off till the future what at the moment would have been hard to=20
accomplish and to endure. He put his hope,in the gradual com=C2=AC=20
promises brought about by time and the pressure of development=20
as such, which in the long run he credited with more strength than=20
any attempt to break the momentary resistance of the individual=20
states at once. Thus, he best demonstrated and proved the great=C2=AC=20
ness of his statesmanship. For in reality the sovereignty of the=20
Reich steadily grew at the expense of the sovereignty of the=20
individual states. Time fulfilled Bismarck=E2=80=99s expectations.=20

With the German collapse and the destruction of the German=20
state form, this development was necessarily accelerated. For=20
since the existence of the individual German states was attribut=C2=AC=20
able less to tribal foundations than to purely political causes, the=20
significance of these individual states inevitably shriveled into=20
nothing once the most essential embodiment of the political=20
development of these states, the monarchic state form and their=20
dynasties , had been excluded. A considerable number of these=20
=E2=80=98 state formations =E2=80=99 lost all internal stability, to such a=
n extent that=20
they voluntarily renounced any further existence and for reasons=20
of pure expediency fused with others or merged with larger ones of=20
their own free will: the most striking proof of the extraordinary=20
weakness of these little formations and the small respect they en=C2=AC=20
joyed even among their own citizens.=20

And so, if the elimination of the monarchic state form and its=20
representatives in itself administered a strong blow to the Reich=E2=80=99s=
=20
character as a federated state, this was even more true of the=20
assumption of the obligations resulting from the =E2=80=98 peace=E2=80=99 t=

the Reich, were necessary effects of the enslavement of our=20
people, gradually initiated by the peace treaties. The Reich was=20
forced to take firm possession of more and more capital, in order=20
to be able to meet the obligations which arose in consequence of=20
further extortions.=20

Insane as th q forms frequently were, in which the centralization=20
was accomplished, the process in itself was logical and natural.=20
Those to blame were the parties and the men who had not done=20
everything in their power to end the War victoriously. Those to=20
blame, especially in Bavaria, were the parties which in pursuit of=20
selfish aims of their own, had during the War wrung from the=20
principle of the Reich concessions which after its loss they had to=20
restore ten times over. Avenging history! Seldom, however, has=20
the punishment of Heaven come so swiftly after the crime as in=20
this case. The same parties, which only a few years previous had=20
placed the interests of their individual states =E2=80=94 and this especial=
ly=20
in Bavaria =E2=80=94 above the interest of the Reich, were now compelled=20
to look on as, beneath the pressure of events, the interest of the=20
Reich throttled the existence of the individual states. All through=20
their own complicity.=20

It is an unequaled hypocrisy to bemoan to the masses of voters=20
(for only toward them is the agitation of our present-day parties=20
directed) the loss of the sovereign rights of the individual prov=C2=AC=20
inces, while all these parties without exception outbid one an=C2=AC=20
other in a policy of fulfillment which in its ultimate consequences=20
could not but lead to deep-seated changes inside Germany. Bis=C2=AC=20
marck=E2=80=99s Germany was free and unbound on the outside. This=20
Reich did not possess financial obligations of so burdensome, and=20
at the same time unproductive, a nature as the present Dawes-=20
Germany has to bear. But internally as well, its competence was=20
limited to a few matters and those absolutely necessary. Thus,=20
it could very well dispense with a financial sovereignty of its own,=20


570=20


Mein Kampf=20


and live from the contributions of the provinces; and it goes=20
without saying that, on the one hand, the continued possession=20
of their own sovereign rights, and, on the other hand, compara=C2=AC=20
tively small financial contributions to the Reich, were very con=C2=AC=20
ducive to satisfaction with the Reich 1 in the provinces. However,=20
it is incorrect, dishonest in fact, to make propaganda today with=20
the assertion that the present lack of satisfaction with the Reich=20
can be attributed solely to the financial bondage of the provinces to=20
the Reich. No, that is not the real state of affairs. The diminished=20
satisfaction with the Reich idea is not attributable to the loss of=20
sovereign rights on the part of the provinces , but is rather the result of=
=20
the deplorable way in which the German people is at present repre=C2=AC=20
sented by it's state. Despite all the Reichsbanner 2 rallies and cele=C2=AC=
=20
brations in honor of the constitution, the present Reich has re=C2=AC=20
mained alien to the heart of the people in all strata, and republi=C2=AC=20
can protective laws may deter people from transgressing against=20
republican institutions, but can never win the love of so much as=20
a single German. In this excessive concern with protecting the Re=C2=AC=20
public against its own citizens by means of penal laws and imprison=C2=AC=
=20
ment lies the most annihilating criticism and disparagement of the=20
whole institution itself.=20

But for another reason as well, the assertion, made by certain=20
parties today, that the disappearance of satisfaction in the Reich=20
is attributable to the encroachments of the Reich against certain=20
sovereign rights of the provinces, is untrue. Assuming that the=20
Reich had not undertaken the extension of its competencies, let=20
no one suppose that the love of the individual provinces for the=20
Reich would be any greater, if nonetheless their total contribu=C2=AC=20
tions had to be the same as now. On the contrary: If the individ=C2=AC=20
ual provinces today had to bear taxes to the amount which the=20
Reich requires for the fulfillment of the slave dictates, hostility=20
toward the Reich would be infinitely greater. Not only would the=20
contributions of the provinces to the Reich be very hard to bring=20
in, but they would have to be raised by means of downright coer-=20

* See page 425, note.=20


National State or Slave Colony?=20


571=20


cion. For since the Republic stands on the basis of the peace=20
treaties, and possesses neither the courage nor any intention what=C2=AC=20
ever of breaking them, it must reckon with its obligations.=20
Solely to blame for this are again the parties which incessantly=20
harangue the patient mass of the voters about the necessary inde=C2=AC=20
pendence of the provinces , but at the same time promote and support a=20
Reich policy which must lead inevitably to the elimination of the very=20
last of these so-called 1 sovereign rights. y=20

I say inevitably because the present Reich retains no other pos=C2=AC=20
sibility of meeting the burdens imposed by its notorious domestic=20
and foreign policy. Here again one wedge drives the next, and=20
every new debt that the Reich heaps upon itself by its criminal=20
handling of German interests abroad, must be balanced at home=20
by a stronger downward pressure which in turn requires the=20
gradual elimination of all sovereign rights of the individual states,=20
in order to prevent germ cells of resistance from arising or merely=20
persisting in them.=20

Altogether, a characteristic difference must be noted between=20
the present Reich policy and that of former days: The old Reich=20
gave internal freedom and demonstrated strength on the outside , while=20
the Republic shows weakness outside and represses its citizens in=C2=AC=20
ternally. In both cases one conditions the other: The powerful=20
national state needs fewer laws within in consequence of the greater=20
love and attachment of its citizens; the international slave state can=20
only hold its subjects to their slave labor by force. For it is one of the=
=20
present regime=E2=80=99s most shameless impertinences to speak of =E2=80=98=
free=20
citizens.=E2=80=99 Only the old Germany possessed such citizens. The Re=C2=
=AC=20
public is a slave colony of foreign countries and has no citizens , but=20
at best subjects. It therefore possesses no national flag , but only a=20
trade-mark , introduced and protected by official decrees and legal=20
measures. This symbol, regarded by everyone as the Gessler=E2=80=99s=20
hat of German democracy, will therefore always remain inwardly=20
alien to our people. The Republic which, without any feeling for=20
tradition and without much respect for the greatness of the past,=20
trod its symbols in the mire, will some day be amazed how super=C2=AC=20
ficially its subjects are attached to its own symbols. It has=20


572=20


Mein Kampf=20


given to itself the character of an intermezzo in German history.=20

And so today this state, for the sake of its own existence, is=20
obliged to curtail the sovereign rights of the individual provinces=20
more and more, not only out of general material considerations,=20
but from ideal considerations as well. For in draining its citizens=20
of their last drop of blood by its policy of financial extortion, it=20
must inevitably withdraw their last rights if it does not want the=20
general discontent to break out into open rebellion some day.=20

By inverting the above proposition, the following rule, basic for=20
us National Socialists, is derived. A powerful national Reich , which=20
takes into account and protects the outward interests of its citizens=20
to the highest extent , can offer freedom within , without having to fear=
=20
for the stability of the state. On the other hand, a powerful national=20
government can undertake and accept responsibility for great limita=C2=AC=
=20
tions on the freedom of the individual as well as the provinces , without=
=20
damage to the Reich idea if in such measures the individual citizen=20
recognizes a means toward the greatness of his nation.=20

Certainly all the states in the world are moving toward a certain=20
unification in their inner organization. And in this Germany will=20
be no exception. Today it is an absurdity to speak of a =E2=80=98state=20
sovereignty=E2=80=99 of individual provinces, which in reality the absurd=
=20
size of these formations in itself fails to provide. The techniques=20
of communication as well as administration steadily diminish the=20
importance of the individual states. Modern communications,=20
modern technology, make distance and space shrink more and=20
more. A state of former days today represents only a province,=20
and the states of the present formerly seemed like continents.=20
The difficulty, from the purely technical point of view, of adminis=C2=AC=
=20
tering a state like Germany is no greater than the difficulty in=20
directing a province like Brandenburg a hundred and twenty years=20
ago. It is today easier to span the distance from Munich to=20
Berlin than that from Munich to Starnberg a hundred years ago.=20
And the whole Reich territory of today is smaller in relation to=20
current communications technique than any medium German=20
federated state at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Anyone who=20
disregards consequences resulting from undeniable facts cannot=20


Misuse oe Centralization=20


573=20


help but remain behind the times. At all times there have been=20
men who do this, and in the future there will be too. But they=20
can scarcely impede the wheel of history, and never bring it to a=20
standstill.=20

We National Socialists must never blindly disregard the conse=C2=AC=20
quences of these truths. Here again we must not let ourselves be=20
taken in by the phrases of our so-called national bourgeois parties.=20
I use the term phrases because these parties themselves do not be=C2=AC=20
lieve seriously in the possibility of carrying out their intentions,=20
and because in the second place they themselves are the accom=C2=AC=20
plices mainly responsible for the present development. Especially=20
in Bavaria, the cry for the elimination of centralization is really=20
nothing more than a party machination without any serious=20
thought behind it. Every time that these parties should really=20
have made something serious out of their phrases, they all of them=20
fell down miserably. Every so-called =E2=80=98theft of sovereign rights =E2=
=80=99=20
from the Bavarian state by the Reich was accepted practically=20
without resistance except for a repulsive yelping. Indeed, if any=C2=AC=20
one really dared to put up serious opposition to this insane system ,=20
he was outlawed and damned and persecuted for 1 contempt of the=20
existing state =E2=80=99 by these very parties, and in the end was silenced=
 either=20
by imprisonment or illegally forbidden to speak. This more than=20
anything should show our supporters the inner hypocrisy of these=20
so-called federalistic circles. The federative state idea, like reli=C2=AC=
=20
gion in part, is only an instrument for their often unclean party=20
interests.=20


# # #=20

Natural as a certain unification may seem, particularly in the field=20
of communications, for us National Socialists there nevertheless re=C2=AC=
=20
mains an obligation to take an energetic position against such a=20
development in the present-day state, at times when the measures only=20
serve the purpose of masking and making possible a catastrophic=20
foreign policy. Precisely because the present Reich did not under-=20


574=20


Mein Kampf=20


take the nationalization of the railroads, postal service, finances,=20
etc., out of higher considerations of national policy, but only in=20
order to lay hands on the financial means and securities for such=20
a policy of unlimited fulfillmentf we National Socialists must do=20
everything that seems in any way calculated to impede and if pos=C2=AC=20
sible prevent the execution of such a policy. And to this belongs=20
the struggle against the present centralization of vitally important=20
institutions of our people, which is undertaken only in order to=20
raise the billions of marks and the collateral for our post-War=20
foreign policy.=20

And for this reason the National Socialist movement has taken=20
a position against such attempts.=20

The second reason which can induce us to offer resistance to=20
such a centralization is that it might stabilize the power of a sys=C2=AC=
=20
tem of internal government which in all its effects has brought=20
the gravest disaster upon the German people. The present Jewish-=20
Democratic Reich, which has become a true curse for the German=20
nation, seeks to make the criticism of the individual states, all of which=
=20
are not yet imbued with this new spirit, ineffectual, by reducing them=20
to total insignificance . In the face of this, we National Socialists=20
have every reason to attempt to give to the opposition of these=20
individual states, not only the foundation of a state power prom=C2=AC=20
ising success, but in general to make their struggle against cen=C2=AC=20
tralization into an expression of a higher, national and universal=20
German interest. And so, while the Bavarian People=E2=80=99s Party en=C2=AC=
=20
deavors to preserve special rights for the Bavarian State out of small-=20
hearted, particularistic motives, we must use this special position in=20
the service of a higher national interest in opposition to the present=20
November democracy.=20

The third reason that can also determine us to fight against=20
the current centralization is the conviction that a great part of=20
the so-called nationalization is in reality no unification, and in no=20
event a simplification, but that in many cases it is only a matter=20
of removing institutions from the sovereign rights of the prov=C2=AC=20
inces, in order to open their gates to the interests of the revolu-=20

1 Fulfillment of the peace treaties, here the reparations provisions.=20


Sovereignty of the Reich=20


575=20


tionary parties. Never in German history has there been a more=20
shameless policy of favoritism than under the democratic Repub=C2=AC=20
lic. A large part of the present frenzy for centralization falls to the=20
account of those parties which once promised to clear the road to=20
ability, but when it came to filling offices and posts solely considered=20
party membership . Since the founding of the Republic, particu=C2=AC=20
larly Jews in incredible numbers poured into the economic con=C2=AC=20
cerns and administrative apparatuses snatched up by the Reich,=20
so that today both have become a domain of Jewish activity.=20

This third consideration above all must obligate us on tactical=20
grounds to examine sharply any further measure on the road to=20
centralization and if necessary to take a position against it. But=20
in this our motives must always be higher motives of national policy=20
and neroer petty particularistic ones.=20

This last remark is necessary lest the opinion arise among our=20
supporters that we National Socialists would not grant the Reich=20
as such the right to embody a higher sovereignty than that of the=20
individual states. Concerning this right, there must and can be no=20
doubt among us. Since for us the state as such is only a form, but=20
the essential is its content, the nation, the people, it is clear that=20
everything else must be subordinated to its sovereign interests. In=20
particular we cannot grant to any individual state within the nation=20
and the state representing it state sovereignty and sovereignty in point=20
of political power. The mischief of individual federated states=20
maintaining so-called missions abroad and among each other=20
must cease and will some day cease. As long as such things are=20
possible, we must not be surprised if foreign countries still doubt=20
the stability of our Reich structure and act accordingly. The mis=C2=AC=20
chief of these missions is all the greater as not the least benefit can=20
be attributed to them along with the harm. The interests of a=20
German abroad, which cannot be protected by the ambassador of=20
the Reich, can much less be looked after by the envoy of a petty=20
state that looks ridiculous in the setting of the present world=20
order. In these petty federated states we can really see nothing=20
but points of attack for separatist endeavors inside and outside of=20
the German Reich, endeavors such as one state still particularly=20


576=20


Mein Kampe=20


welcomes. And we National Socialists can have no sympathy=20
with some noble family, grown feeble with age, providing new soil=20
for a withered scion by clothing him in an ambassadorial post.=20
Our diplomatic missions abroad were so miserable even at the=20
time of the old Reich that further additions to the experience then=20
gained are highly superfluous.=20

In future the significance of the individual provinces will un=C2=AC=20
questionably be shifted more to the field of cultural policy. The=20
monarch who did the most for the importance of Bavaria was not=20
some stubborn anti-German particularist, but Ludwig I, a man of=20
pan-German mind and artistic sensibilities. By using the forces of=20
the state primarily for the development of Bavaria=E2=80=99s cultural=20
position and not for the strengthening of her political power, he=20
built better and more enduringly than would otherwise have been=20
possible. By pushing Munich from the level of an insignificant=20
provincial capital into the format of a great German art metropo=C2=AC=20
lis, 1 he created a spiritual center which even today is strong=20
enough to bind the essentially different Franks to this state.=20
Supposing that Munich had remained what it formerly was, the=20
same process that took place in Saxony would have been repeated=20
in Bavaria, only with the difference that Nuremberg, the Bavarian=20
Leipzig, would have become not a Bavarian but a Frankish city.=20
It was not the =E2=80=98Down with Prussia=E2=80=99 shouters that made Munic=
h=20
great; this city was given its importance by the King who in it=20
wished to bestow upon the German nation an art treasure which=20
would have to be seen and respected, and which was seen and=20
respected. And therein lies a lesson for the future. The importance=20
of the individual states will in the future no longer lie in the fields of=
=20
state power and policy; I see it either in the tribal field or the field of=
=20
cultural policy. But even here time will have a leveling effect.=20
The ease of modern transportation so scatters people around that=20
slowly and steadily the tribal boundaries are effaced and thus=20
even the cultural picture gradually begins to even out.=20

Army and Separate States=20


577=20


The army in particular must be sharply removed from all in=C2=AC=20
fluence of the individual states. The coming National Socialist=20
state must not fall into the error of the past and attribute to the=20
army a function which it has not and must not have. The German=20
army does not exist to be a school for the preservation of tribal peculi=C2=
=AC=20
arities, but should rather be a school for the mutual understanding=20
and adaptation of all Germans. Whatever source of division there=20
may be in the life of the nation must be given a unifying effect by=20
the army. Furthermore, it must raise the individual young man=20
from the narrow horizon of his little province and put him into=20
the German nation. He must learn to see, not the boundaries of=20
his home province, but those of his fatherland; for it is these that=20
he will one day have to protect. It is, therefore, senseless to leave=20
the young German at home; the expedient thing is to show him=20
Germany during his period of military service. Today this is=20
all the more necessary, as the young German no longer has his=20
years of wandering apprenticeship with their broadening effect on=20
his horizon. In view of this, is it not preposterous to leave, when=20
possible, the young Bavarian in Munich, the Frank in Nurem=C2=AC=20
berg, the Badener in Karlsruhe, the Wiirttemberger in Stuttgart,=20
etc., and is it not more sensible to show the young Bavarian the=20
Rhine and the North Sea, the Hamburger the Alps, the East=20
Prussian the mountains of Central Germany, and so on? Regional=20
character should remain in the detachment, but not in the garri=C2=AC=20
son. Every attempt at centralization may encounter our disap=C2=AC=20
proval, but that of the army never! On the contrary, even if we=20
welcomed no such endeavor, we should have to take pleasure in=20
this one. Quite aside from the fact that, in view of the size of the=20
present Reich army, the preservation of individual state troop=20
formations would be absurd, we regard the unification of the=20
Reich army that has taken place as a step which, in the future,=20
when a national army has been introduced, we must never again=20
abandon.=20

Moreover , a young victorious idea will have to reject any fetter=20
which might paralyze its activity in pushing forward its conceptions.=20
National Socialism as a matter of principle , must lay claim to the=20


578=20


Mein Kampe=20


right to force its principles on the whole German nation without con=C2=AC=
=20
sideration of previous federated state boundaries, and to educate it in=20
its ideas and conceptions. Just as the churches do not feel bound and=20
limited by political boundaries, no more does the National Socialist=20
idea feel limited by the individual state territories of our fatherland.=20

The National Socialist doctrine is not the servant of individual=20
federated states, but shall some day become the master of the German=20
nation. It must determine and reorder the life of a people, and must ,=20
therefore, imperiously claim the right to pass over boundaries drawn=20
by a development we have rejected.=20

The more complete the victory of its ideas will be, the greater may be=20
the particular liberties it offers internally.=20




CHAPTER=20

XI=20


Propaganda and Organization=20


I=20

An several respects the year 1921 had as=C2=AC=20
sumed a special significance for me and the movement.=20

After my entrance into the German Workers=E2=80=99 Party, I at once=20
took over the management of propaganda. I regarded this de=C2=AC=20
partment as by far the most important. For the present, it was=20
less important to rack one=E2=80=99s brains over organizational questions=
=20
than to transmit the idea itself to a larger number of people.=20
Propaganda had to run far in advance of organization and provide=20
it with the human material to be worked on. Moreover, I am an=20
enemy of too rapid and too pedantic organizing. It usually pro=C2=AC=20
duces nothing but a dead mechanism, seldom a living organiza=C2=AC=20
tion. For organization is a thing that owes its existence to=20
organic life, organic development. Ideas which have gripped a=20
certain number of people will always strive for a greater order,=20
and a great value must be attributed to this inner molding. Here,=20
too, we must reckon with the weakness of men, which leads the=20
individual, at first at least, instinctively to resist a superior mind.=20
If an organization is mechanically ordered from above, there=20
exists a great danger that a once appointed leader, not yet ac=C2=AC=20
curately evaluated and perhaps none too capable, will from=20
jealousy strive to prevent the rise of abler elements within the=20
movement. The harm that arises in such a case can, especially in=20
a young movement, be of catastrophic significance.=20

For this reason it is more expedient for a time to disseminate=20


580=20


Mein Kampf=20


an idea by propaganda from a central point and then carefully to=20
search and examine the gradually gathering human material for=20
leading minds. Sometimes it will turn out that men inconspicu=C2=AC=20
ous in themselves must nevertheless be regarded as born leaders.=20

But it would be absolutely mistaken to regard a wealth of theoretical=20
knowledge as characteristic proof for the qualities and abilities of a=20
leader.=20

The opposite is often the case.=20

The great theoreticians are only in the rarest cases great organ=C2=AC=20
izers, since the greatness of the theoretician and program-maker lies=20
primarily in the recognition and establishment of abstractly correct=20
laws, while the organizer must primarily be a psychologist. He=20
must take people as they are and must therefore know them.=20
He must not overestimate them, any more than he must under=C2=AC=20
estimate them in the mass. On the contrary, he must endeavor=20
to take weakness and bestiality equally into account, in order,=20
considering all factors, to create a formation which will be a living=20
organism, imbued with strong and stable power, and thus suited=20
to upholding an idea and paving the way for its success.=20

Even more seldom, however, is a great theoretician a great=20
leader. Much more readily will an agitator be-one, something=20
which many who only work scientifically on the question do not=20
want to hear. And yet that is understandable. An agitator who=20
demonstrates the ability to transmit an idea to the broad masses=20
must always be a psychologist, even if he were only a demagogue.=20
Then he will still be more suited for leadership than the unworldly=20
theoretician, who is ignorant of people. For leading means: being=20
able to move masses. The gift of shaping ideas has nothing to do=20
with ability as a leader. And it is quite useless to argue which is=20
of greater importance, to set up ideals and aims for mankind, or=20
to realize them. Here, as so often in life: one would be utterly=20
meaningless without the other. The finest theoretical insight re=C2=AC=20
mains without purpose and value if the leader does not set the=20
masses in motion toward it. And conversely, of what avail would=20
be all the genius and energy of a leader, if the brilliant theoretician=20
did not set up aims for the human struggle? However, the com-=20


Supporters and Members=20


581=20


bination of theoretician, organizer, and leader in one person is=20
the rarest thing that can be found on this earth; this combination=20
makes the great man.=20

As I have already remarked, I devoted myself to propaganda in=20
the first period of my activity in the movement. What it had to do=20
was gradually to fill a small nucleus of men with the new doctrine,=20
and so prepare the material which could later furnish the first=20
elements of an organization.=20

When a movement harbors the purpose of tearing down a world=20
and building another in its place, complete clarity must reign in=20
the ranks of its own leadership with regard to the following prin=C2=AC=20
ciples:=20

Every movement will first have to sift the human material it wins=20
into two large groups: supporters and members.=20

The function of propaganda is to attract supporters, the function=20
of organization to win members.=20

A supporter of a movement is one who declares himself to be in=20
agreement with its aims, a member is one who fights for them.=20

The supporter is made amenable to the movement by propaganda.=20
The member is induced by the organization to participate personally=20
in the recruiting of new supporters, from whom in turn members can=20
be developed.=20

Since being a supporter requires only a passive recognition of an=20
idea, while membership demands active advocacy and defense, to ten=20
supporters there will at most be one or two members.=20

Being a supporter is rooted only in understanding, membership in=20
the courage personally to advocate and disseminate what has been=20
understood.=20

Understanding in its passive form corresponds to the majority of=20
mankind which is lazy and cowardly. Membership requires an activ-=20
istic frame of mind and thus corresponds only to the minority of men.=20

Propaganda will consequently have to see that an idea wins sup=C2=AC=20
porters, while the organization must take the greatest care only to=20
make the most valuable elements among the supporters into members.=20
Propaganda does not, therefore, need to rack its brains with regard to=20
the importance of every individual instructed by it, with regard to=20


582=20


Mein Kampf=20


his ability, capacity, and understanding, or character, while the=20
organization must carefully gather from the mass of these elements=20
those which really make possible the victory of the movement .=20

WWW=20

Propaganda tries to force a doctrine on the whole people; the organ=C2=AC=
=20
ization embraces within its scope only those who do not threaten on=20
psychological grounds to become a brake on the further dissemination=20
of the idea.=20


WWW=20

Propaganda works on the general public from the standpoint of an=20
idea and makes them ripe for the victory of this idea, while the or=C2=AC=
=20
ganization achieves victory by the persistent, organic, awd militant=20
union of those supporters who seem willing and able to carry on the=20
fight for victory .=20


# * *=20

The victory of an idea will be possible the sooner, the more com=C2=AC=20
prehensively propaganda has prepared people as a whole and the more=20
exclusive, rigid , and firm the organization which carries out the fight=20
in practice.=20

From this it results that the number of supporters cannot be too=20
large, but that the number of members can more readily be too large=20
than too small.=20


=E2=80=A2U.=20

WWW=20

If propaganda has imbued a whole people with an idea, the organ=C2=AC=20
ization can draw the consequences with a handful of men. Propa=C2=AC=20
ganda and organization , in other words, supporters and members.=20


Propaganda and Organization=20


583=20


thus stand in a certain mutual relation. The better the propaganda=20
has worked, the smaller the organization can be; and the larger the=20
number of supporters, the more modest the number of members can be;=20
and vice versa: the poorer the propaganda is, the larger the organiza=C2=AC=
=20
tion must be, and the smaller the host of followers of a movement re=C2=AC=
=20
mains, the more extensive the number of its members must be, if it=20
still hopes to count on any success at all.=20


The first task of propaganda is to win people for subsequent=20
organization; the first task of organization is to win men for the=20
continuation of propaganda. The second task of propaganda is the=20
disruption of the existing state of affairs and the permeation of this=20
state of affairs with the new doctrine, while the second task of organi=C2=
=AC=20
zation must be the struggle for power, thus to achieve the final success=20
of the doctrine.=20


.y-=20

The most striking success of a revolution based on a philosophy of=20
life will always have been achieved when the new philosophy of life as=20
far as possible has been taught to all men, and, if necessary, later=20
forced upon them, while the organization of the idea, in other words,=20
the movement, should embrace only as many as are ' absolutely re=C2=AC=20
quired for occupying the nerve centers of the state in question.=20

This, in other words, means the following:=20

In every really great world-shaking movement, propaganda will=20
first have to spread the idea of this movement. Thus, it will inde-=20
fatigably attempt to make the new thought processes clear to the=20
others, and therefore to draw them over to their own ground, or=20
to make them uncertain of their previous conviction. Now,=20
since the dissemination of an idea, that is, propaganda, must have=20
a firm backbone, the doctrine will have to give itself a solid organ-=20


584=20


Mein Kampf=20


ization. The organization obtains its members from the general=20
body of supporters won by propaganda. The latter will grow the=20
more rapidly, the more intensively the propaganda is carried on,=20
and the latter in turn can work better, the stronger and more=20
powerful the organization is that stands behind it.=20

Hence it is the highest task of the organization to make sure=20
that no inner disunities within the membership of the movement=20
lead to a split and hence a weakening of the movement=E2=80=99s work;=20
further, that the spirit of determined attack does not die out, but=20
is continuously renewed and reinforced. The number of members=20
need not grow infinitely; on the contrary: since only a small frac=C2=AC=20
tion of mankind is by nature energetic and bold, a movement=20
which endlessly enlarges its organization would inevitably be=20
weakened some day as a result. Organizations , in other words ,=20
membership figures, which grow beyond a certain level gradually lose=20
their fighting power and are no longer capable of supporting or=20
utilizing the propaganda of an idea resolutely and aggressively.=20

The greater and more essentially revolutionary an idea is, the more=20
activistic its membership will become, since the revolutionary force of=20
a doctrine involves a danger for its supporters, which seems calculated=20
to keep cowardly little shopkeepers away from it. They will pri=C2=AC=20
vately regard themselves as supporters, but decline to make a=20
public avowal of this by membership. By virtue of this fact, the=20
organization of a really revolutionary idea obtains as members only=20
the most active among the supporters won over by propaganda. And=20
precisely in this activity of a movement=E2=80=99s membership, guaranteed=
=20
by natural selection, lies the premise for equally active future=20
propaganda as well as a successful struggle for the realization of=20
the idea.=20

The greatest danger that can threaten a movement is a mem=C2=AC=20
bership which has grown abnormally as a result of too rapid suc=C2=AC=20
cesses. For, just as a movement is shunned by all cowardly and=20
egotistic individuals, as long as it has to fight bitterly, these same=20
people rush with equal alacrity to acquire membership when a=20
success of the party has been made probable or already realized=20
by developments,=20


Limitation of Membership=20


585=20


To this it must be ascribed why 1 many victorious movements,=20
on the point of success, or, rather, the ultimate completion of=20
their will, suddenly from inexplicable inner weakness, flag, stop=20
fighting, and finally die out. In consequence of their first victory,=20
so many inferior, unworthy, and worst of all cowardly, elements=20
have entered their organization that these inferior people finally=20
achieve predominance over the militants and then force the move=C2=AC=20
ment into the service of their own interests, lower it to the level of=20
their own scanty heroism, and do nothing to complete the victory=20
of the original idea. The fanatical zeal has been blurred, the fight=C2=AC=
=20
ing force paralyzed, or, as the bourgeois world correctly puts it in=20
such cases: =E2=80=98 Water has been mixed with the wined And when that=20
happens, the trees can no longer grow skyward.=20

It is, therefore, most necessary that a movement, for pure reasons=20
of self-preservation, should, once it has begun to achieve success ,=20
immediately block enrollments and henceforth increase its organiza=C2=AC=20
tion only with extreme caution and after the most thorough scrutiny.=20
Only in this way will it be able to preserve the core of the move=C2=AC=20
ment in unvitiated freshness and health. It must see to it that,=20
from this point on, this core alone shall exclusively lead the movement,=20
that is, determine the propaganda which should lead to its universal=20
recognition, and, in full possession of the power, undertake the=20
actions which are necessary for the practical realization of its ideas.=20

It must not only occupy all the important positions of the con=C2=AC=20
quered territory with the basic core of the old movement, but also=20
constitute the entire leadership. And this until the principles and=20
doctrines of the party have become the foundation and content of=20
the new state. Only then can the reins gradually be handed over=20
to the special government of this state, born of its spirit. This,=20
however, in turn occurs for the most part only in mutual struggle,=20
since it is less a question of human insight than of the play and=20
workings of forces which can perhaps be recognized from the first,=20
but cannot forever be guided.=20

All great movements, whether of a religious or a political nature ,=20
must attribute their mighty successes only to the recognition and ap-=20

are not even thinkable without consideration of these laws.=20

As director of the party=E2=80=99s propaganda I took much pains, not=20
only to prepare the soil for the future greatness of the movement,=20
but by an extremely radical conception in this work I also strove=20
to bring it about that the party should obtain only the best ma=C2=AC=20
terial. For the more radical and inflammatory my propaganda=20
was, the more this frightened weaklings and hesitant characters,=20
and prevented them from penetrating the primary core of our=20
organization. They might continue as supporters, but certainly=20
not with loud emphasis; they timidly concealed the fact. How=20
many thousands assured me at that time that they were essen=C2=AC=20
tially in agreement with everything we said, but that under no=20
circumstances could they become members. The movement,=20
they said, was so radical that membership in it would expose=20
the individual to the gravest difficulties, nay, dangers, and we=20
shouldn=E2=80=99t take it amiss if the honest, peaceable citizen should=20
stand aside for the present at least, even if at heart he was entirely=20
with the cause.=20

And this was good.=20

If these men, who at heart were not for the revolution, had all=20
come into our party at that time, and as members, we could re=C2=AC=20
gard ourselves today as a pious fraternal organization, but no=20
longer as a young militant movement.=20

The live and aggressive form that I then gave to our propa=C2=AC=20
ganda reinforced and guaranteed the radical tendency of our=20
movement, since now only radical people =E2=80=94 with some exceptions=20
=E2=80=94 were ready for membership.=20

At the same time, this propaganda had the effect that after a=20
short while hundreds of thousands not only believed us to be right=20
but desired our victory, even if personally they were too cowardly=20
to make sacrifices for it, let alone fight for it.=20


Reorganization of the Movement=20


587=20


Up to the middle of 1921 this purely propagandist activity=20
could still suffice and benefit the movement. But special events in=20
the midsummer of this year made it seem indicated that now,=20
after the slowly visible success of our propaganda, the organiza=C2=AC=20
tion should be adapted to it and put on a par with it.=20

The attempt of a group of folkish lunatics to obtain the leader=C2=AC=20
ship of the party, with the aid and support of the party chairman=20
of the time, led to the collapse of this little intrigue and, at a=20
general membership meeting, unanimously gave me the leader=C2=AC=20
ship over the whole movement. Immediately, a new by-law was=20
passed, transferring full responsibility to the first chairman of=20
the party, eliminating committee decisions as a matter of princi=C2=AC=20
ple, and introducing instead a system of division of labor which=20
has since proved its worth in the most beneficial way.=20

Beginning on August 1, 1921,1 took over this inner reorganiza=C2=AC=20
tion of the movement and in so doing found the support of a num=C2=AC=20
ber of excellent people whom I consider it necessary to mention=20
in a special appendix.=20

In the attempt to organizationally exploit the results of propa=C2=AC=20
ganda and thereby establish them for all time, I had to do away=20
with a number of previous habits and introduce principles which=20
none of the existing parties possessed or would even have recog=C2=AC=20
nized.=20

In the years from 1919 to 1920 the movement had for leader=C2=AC=20
ship a committee which was chosen by membership meetings,=20
which themselves in turn were prescribed by rule. The commit=C2=AC=20
tee consisted of a first and second treasurer, a first and second=20
secretary, and at the head, a first and second chairman. Added=20
to these was a membership secretary, the propaganda chief, and=20
various assisting committeemen.=20

Strange as it may seem, this committee actually embodied=20
exactly what the party most wanted to combat, namely, parlia -=20
mentarianism. For it was obvious that we were involved with a=20
principle which from the smallest local group, through the later=20
districts, counties, and provinces, up to the Reich leadership,=20
embodied the very same system under which we all suffered and=20
today still suffer.=20


588=20


Mein Kampe=20


It was urgently necessary to bring about a change in this some=20
day, unless the movement, in consequence of the poor foundation=20
of its inner organization, were to be forever ruined and hence in=C2=AC=20
capable of ever fulfilling its high mission.=20

The committee sessions, of which minutes were kept, and in=20
which votes were taken and decisions made by a majority, repre=C2=AC=20
sented in reality a parliament on a small scale. Here, too, all=20
personal responsibility was lacking. Here, too, the same irra=C2=AC=20
tionality and the same unreasonableness reigned as in our great=20
state representative bodies. For this committee, secretaries,=20
treasurers, membership secretaries, propaganda chiefs, and God=20
knows what else were appointed, and then all of them together=20
were made to deliberate on every single question and decide by=20
vote. And so the man who was there for propaganda voted on a=20
matter that regarded the finance man, and he in turn voted on a=20
matter regarding organization, and the latter in turn on a matter=20
which should only have concerned the secretary, etc.=20

Why they bothered to appoint a special man for propaganda,=20
when treasurers, secretaries, membership secretaries, etc., had to=20
decide on questions regarding it, seems just as incomprehensible=20
to a healthy mind as it would be incomprehensible if in a big in=C2=AC=20
dustrial enterprise the directors or engineers of other departments=20
and other branches had to decide on questions having nothing to=20
do with their affairs.=20

I did not submit to this lunacy, but after a short time stayed=20
away from the sessions. I did my propaganda work and let it go=20
at that, and I did not stand for any incompetent trying to tell me=20
what to do in this field. Just as, conversely, I did not interfere=20
in the business of the others.=20

When the acceptance of the new statutes and my appointment=20
to the position of first chairman had meanwhile given me the=20
necessary authority and the rights that went with it, this non=C2=AC=20
sense immediately stopped. In the place of committee decisions,=20
the principle of absolute responsibility was introduced.=20

The first chairman is responsible for the total leadership of the=20
movement. He apportions the work to be performed among the=20


Responsibility of the Leader=20


589=20


committeemen subordinated to him and among whatever other=20
collaborators are needed. And each one of these gentlemen is=20
absolutely responsible for the tasks transferred to him. He is=20
subordinated only to the first chairman, who must procure the=20
cooperation of all, or else must bring about this cooperation by=20
the choice of persons and the issuance of general directives.=20

This law of fundamental responsibility was gradually taken for=20
granted within the movement, at least in so far as the party lead=C2=AC=20
ership was concerned. In the little local groups and perhaps even=20
in the counties and districts, it will take years before these prin=C2=AC=
=20
ciples will be forced through, since scare-cats and incompetents=20
will of course always fight against it; to them sole responsibility=20
for an undertaking will always be unpleasant; they always felt=20
freer and better when in every grave decision they were covered=20
by the majority of a so-called committee. But to me it seems=20
necessary to express myself with the greatest sharpness against=20
such an attitude, to make no concession to cowardice in the face=20
of responsibility, and thereby, even if it takes a long time, to=20
achieve a conception of leader=E2=80=99s duty and leader=E2=80=99s ability,=
 which=20
will bring to leadership exclusively those who are really called and=20
chosen for it.=20

In any case a movement that wants to combat the parliamen=C2=AC=20
tary madness must itself be free of it. Only on such a basis can it=20
win the strength for its struggle.=20

A movement which in a time of majority rule orients itself in all=20
things on the principle of the leader idea and the responsibility con=C2=AC=
=20
ditioned by it will some day with mathematical cei tainty overcome the=20
existing state of affairs and emerge victorious .=20

This idea led to a complete reorganization within the move=C2=AC=20
ment. And in its logical effects also to an extremely sharp division=20
between the business activities of the movement and the general=20
political leadership. As a matter of principle, the idea of re=C2=AC=20
sponsibility was extended to all the party activities and led in=C2=AC=20
evitably to their recovery, in exact proportion as they were freed=20
from political influences and adjusted to purely economic con=C2=AC=20
siderations.=20

Mein Kampe=20


When in the fall of 1919,1 joined the handful of men who then=20
constituted the party, it had neither a business office nor a clerk,=20
not even forms or rubber stamps; and no printed matter existed.=20
The committee room was first a tavern in the Herrengasse, and=20
later a cafe on the Gasteig. That was an impossible state of af=C2=AC=20
fairs. Soon afterward I started out and visited a number of Mu=C2=AC=20
nich restaurants and taverns with the intention of renting a back=20
room or some other space for the party. In the former Sternecker-=20
brau in the Tal, there was a small vault-like room which had=20
once served the imperial councilors 1 of Bavaria as a sort of tap-=20
room. It was dark and gloomy and thus was just as well suited=20
for its former purpose as it was ill-suited for its projected new use.=20
The alley on which its single window opened was so narrow that=20
even on the brightest summer day the room remained gloomy=20
and dark. This became our first business office. But since the=20
monthly rent was only fifty marks (then an exorbitant sum for=20
us!), we could make no greater demands and were not even in a=20
position to complain when, before we moved in, the wall paneling,=20
formerly intended for the imperial councilors, was quickly torn=20
out, so that now the room really gave more the impression of a=20
funeral vault than of an office.=20

And yet this was an immense step forward. Slowly we obtained=20
electric light, even more slowly a telephone; a table and a few=20
borrowed chairs were brought in, finally an open book-stand, still=20
somewhat later a cupboard; two sideboards belonging to the land=C2=AC=20
lord served for keeping pamphlets, posters, etc.=20

The previous system =E2=80=94 that is, having the movement run by a=20
committee session taking place once a week =E2=80=94 was impossible in=20
the long run. Only an official paid by the movement could guar=C2=AC=20
antee the day-to-day business organization.=20

At the time that was very difficult. The movement still had so=20
few members that it took great skill to find among them a suitable=20
man who, making the smallest demands for his own person, could=20
satisfy the innumerable demands of the movement.=20

591=20


In the person of a soldier, named Schiissler, one of my former=20
comrades, the first business manager of the party was found.=20
At first he came to our new office only daily from six to eight o=E2=80=99=
=C2=AC=20
clock, later from five to eight, finally every afternoon, and shortly=20
afterward he was taken on full time and served from morning un=C2=AC=20
til late into the night. He was a man as conscientious as he was=20
upright and absolutely honest, who personally took the greatest=20
pains and was devoted with especial loyalty to the movement it=C2=AC=20
self. Schiissler brought with him a small Adler typewriter that=20
belonged to him. It was the first such instrument in the service=20
of our movement. Later the party acquired it by installment pay=C2=AC=20
ments. A small safe seemed necessary to safeguard the card in=C2=AC=20
dex and the membership books from thieves. We did not acquire=20
it in order to deposit any large sums of money we might have had=20
at the time. On the contrary, everything was extremely thread=C2=AC=20
bare, and often I contributed from my own small savings.=20

A year and a half later, the business office was too small, and=20
we moved into a new place in the Corneliusstrasse. Again it was=20
a tavern we moved to, but now we no longer possessed only a sin=C2=AC=20
gle room, but three rooms and one large additional room with a=20
wicket-window. At the time that seemed to us like a good deal.=20
Here we remained until November, 1923.=20

In December, 1920, we acquired the Volkischer Beobachter.=20
This paper, which, as its name indicates, stood on the whole for=20
folkish interests even then, was now to be transformed into the=20
organ of the NSDAP. At first it appeared twice a week, at the=20
beginning of 1923 became a daily, and at the end of August, 1923,=20
it received its large format which later became well known.=20

As a total novice in the field of journalism, I sometimes had to=20
pay dearly for my experience in those days.=20

The mere fact that in comparison with the enormous Jewish=20
press there was hardly a single really significant folkish paper=20
gave food for thought. This, as I later ascertained any number of=20
times in practice, was in large part due to the unbusinesslike=20
management of so-called folkish enterprises in general. They=20
were too much conducted from the angle that loyalty takes=20


592=20


Mein Kampf=20


precedence over achievement. An absolutely false standpoint,=20
in so far as loyalty must not be an outward thing, but find its=20
most eminent expression in achievement. Anyone who creates=20
something really valuable for his people thus gives evidence of=20
an equally valuable loyalty, while another, who merely displays=20
hypocritical loyalty, but in reality performs no useful services for=20
his people, is an enemy to any true loyalty. And his loyalty is a=20
burden to the community.=20

The Volkischer Beobachter, as its very name indicates, was also=20
a folkish organ, with all the advantages, and even more faults and=20
weaknesses, that were characteristic of folkish institutions. Hon=C2=AC=20
est as its content was, the management of the enterprise was im=C2=AC=20
possible from the commercial viewpoint. It, too, was run on the=20
assumption that folkish newspapers must be supported by folkish=20
contributions, instead of the principle that they must make their=20
way in competition with other papers and that it is indecent to=20
cover the negligence or mistakes of their business management=20
by the donations of well-situated patriots.=20

In any case I attempted to eliminate this state of affairs, the=20
objectionableness of which I had soon recognized, and luck fa=C2=AC=20
vored me by making me acquainted with the man who since=20
then, not only as business manager of the paper, but also of the=20
party, has performed services of the greatest value for the move=C2=AC=20
ment. In 1914 =E2=80=94 at the front, that is =E2=80=94 I met Max Amann, th=
e=20
present general business manager of the party (then still my su=C2=AC=20
perior in rank). During the four years of the War, I had an=20
almost continuous opportunity to observe the extraordinary abil=C2=AC=20
ity, the industry and scrupulous conscientiousness of my future=20
collaborator.=20

In midsummer of 1921, when the movement was in a grave=20
crisis and I could no longer be satisfied with a number of em=C2=AC=20
ployees, and with one in fact had had the bitterest experience, I=20
turned to my former regimental comrade, whom chance brought=20
to me one day, with the request that he become business manager=20
of the movement. After long hesitation =E2=80=94 Amann was holding=20

condition that he would never serve as a stooge for any incom=C2=AC=20
petent committees, but would exclusively recognize a single mas=C2=AC=20
ter.=20

It is the inextinguishable merit of this first business manager=20
of the movement, a man of really comprehensive business train=C2=AC=20
ing, to have brought order and neatness into the party=E2=80=99s business=
=20
affairs. Since that time they have remained exemplary and could=20
be equaled, let alone surpassed, by none of the subdivisions of the=20
movement, but, as always in life, outstanding ability is not sel=C2=AC=20
dom the cause of envy and disfavor. This, of course, had to be=20
expected in this case and to be taken patiently into account.=20

By 1922 there existed, by and large, firm directives for the=20
business as well as the purely organizational development of the=20
movement. There was already a complete central card index=20
which embraced all members belonging to the movement. Like=C2=AC=20
wise the financing of the movement had been brought into healthy=20
channels. Current expenses had to be covered by current re=C2=AC=20
ceipts; extraordinary receipts were used only for extraordinary=20
expenses. Despite the hard times, the movement thereby re=C2=AC=20
mained, apart from small running accounts, almost free of debt,=20
and even succeeded in steadily increasing its resources. We=20
worked as in a private business: the employed personnel had to=20
distinguish itself by achievement, and could not get by on the=20
strength of any of your famous =E2=80=98loyalty.=E2=80=99 The loyalty of ev=
ery=20
National Socialist is demonstrated primarily by his readiness to=20
work, his industry and ability in accomplishing the work en=C2=AC=20
trusted to him by the community. Anyone who does not fulfill=20
his duty in this should not boast of his loyalty, against which he=20
is actually committing an offense. With the utmost energy the=20
new business manager, in opposition to all possible influences,=20
upheld the standpoint that party enterprises must not be a=20
sinecure for supporters or members with no great enthusiasm for=20
work. A movement which fights in so sharp a form against the=20
party corruption of our present administrative apparatus must=20
keep its own apparatus pure of such vices. There were cases where=20
employees were taken into the administration of the newspaper,=20


594=20


Mein Kampf=20


who in their previous allegiance belonged to the Bavarian Peo=C2=AC=20
ple=E2=80=99s Party, but, measured by their achievements, showed them=C2=AC=
=20
selves excellently qualified. The result of this attempt was in=20
general outstanding. By this honest and frank recognition of the=20
individual=E2=80=99s real achievement, the movement more quickly and=20
more thoroughly won the hearts of its employees than would=20
otherwise have been the case. They later became good National=20
Socialists and remained so, and not only in words; they also=20
demonstrated it by the conscientious, regular, and honest work=20
which they performed in the service of the new movement. It=20
goes without saying that the well-qualified party comrade was=20
given preference over the equally qualified non-party member.=20
But no one obtained a position on the basis of his party member=C2=AC=20
ship alone. The firmness with which the new business manager=20
upheld these principles, and gradually enforced them despite all=20
opposition, was later of the greatest benefit to the movement.=20
Through this alone was it possible, in the difficult inflation period,=20
when tens of thousands of businesses collapsed and thousands of=20
newspapers had to close, for the business leadership of the move=C2=AC=20
ment, not only to remain above water and fulfill its tasks, but for=20
the Volkischer Beobachter to be expanded more and more. It=20
had entered the ranks of the great newspapers.=20

The year 1921 had, furthermore, the significance that I gradu=C2=AC=20
ally succeeded, through my position as chairman of the party, in=20
withdrawing the various party services from the criticism and=20
interference of dozens of committee members. This was impor=C2=AC=20
tant, because it was impossible to obtain a really capable mind=20
for a job if incompetents kept on babbling and interfering, know=C2=AC=20
ing everything better than anyone else and actually creating a=20
hopeless muddle. Whereupon, to be sure, these know-it-alls=20
usually withdrew quite modestly, to seek a new field for their in=C2=AC=20
spiring supervisory activity. There were men who were possessed=20
by a positive disease for finding something behind anything and=20
everything, and who were in a kind of continuous pregnancy with=20
excellent plans, ideas, projects, methods. Their highest and most=20
ideal aim was usually the formation of a committee or controlling=20


Building the Movement=20


595=20


organ to put its expert nose into other people=E2=80=99s serious work.=20
It never dawned on many of these committee people how insult=C2=AC=20
ing and how un-National Socialist it is, when men who do not=20
understand a thing keep interfering with real specialists. In any=20
case, I regarded it as my duty in these years, to take all real work=C2=AC=
=20
ers, charged with responsibility in the movement, under my pro=C2=AC=20
tection against such elements, to cover them in the rear, as it=20
were, so as to leave them free to work forward.=20

The best means for making harmless such committees, who did=20
nothing and only cooked up decisions that could not be practi=C2=AC=20
cally carried out, was to assign them to some real work. It was=20
laughable how silently one of these clubs would then disappear,=20
and suddenly was impossible to locate. It made me think of our=20
greatest institution of the sort, the Reichstag. How ail its mem=C2=AC=20
bers would suddenly evaporate if, instead of talk, some real work=20
were assigned to them; and particularly a task which every single=20
one of these braggarts would have to perform with personal=20
responsibility.=20

Even then I always raised the demand that, in the movement=20
as everywhere in private life, we keep looking until the obviously=20
capable official, administrator, or director for the various business=20
sections had been found. And this man was then to receive un=C2=AC=20
conditional authority and freedom of action downward, but to=20
be charged with unlimited responsibility upward, and no one ob=C2=AC=20
tains authority toward subordinates who does not know the work=20
involved better than they. In the course of two years, I enforced=20
my opinion more and more, and today it is taken for granted in=20
the movement, at least in so far as the top leadership is con=C2=AC=20
cerned.=20

The visible success of this attitude was shown on November 9,=20
1923: when I came to the movement four years previous, not even=20
a rubber stamp was available. On November 9, the party was=20
dissolved, its property confiscated. This, including all properties=20
and the newspaper, already amounted to over a hundred and=20
seventy thousand gold marks.=20


CHAPTER=20

XII=20


The Trade-Union Question=20


T=20

A he rapid growth of the movement=20
compelled us in 1922 to take a position on a question which even=20
today is not entirely solved.=20

In our attempts to study those methods which could most=20
easily open up to the movement the way to the hearts of the=20
masses, we always encountered the objection that the worker=20
could never be entirely with us because the defense of his inter=C2=AC=20
ests in the purely occupational and economic field lay in the=20
hands of our enemies and their organizations.=20

This objection, of course, had much to be said for it. It was a=20
matter of general belief that the worker who was active in a=20
factory could not even exist unless he became a member of a=20
union. Not only that his occupational interests seemed protected=20
by this alone, but his position in the factory for any length of=20
time was conceivable only as a union member. The majority=20
of the workers were organized in trade unions. These, on the=20
whole, had fought out the wage struggles and concluded the=20
agreements which assured the worker of a certain income.=20
Without doubt the results of these struggles benefited all the=20
workers in the factory, and inevitably conflicts of conscience=20
arose, especially for the decent man, if he pocketed the wage=20
which the unions had won him, but remained aloof from the=20
Struggle.=20

It was hard to speak of these problems with the average=20


Are Trade Unions Necessary?=20


597=20


bourgeois employer. They neither had (or perhaps wanted to=20
have) any understanding for the material side of the question=20
nor for the moral side. Finally, their own supposed economic=20
interests argue from the start against any organizational group=C2=AC=20
ing of the workers under them, and for this reason alone most=20
of them can hardly form an unprejudiced judgment. Here, as=20
so often, it is therefore necessary to turn to outsiders who do not=20
succumb to the temptation of not seeing the forest for the trees.=20
These, with good will, will much more easily achieve understand=C2=AC=20
ing for a matter which in any event is among the most important=20
of our present and future life.=20

In the first volume I have expressed myself with regard to the=20
nature and purpose, and the necessity, of trade unions. There I=20
espoused the viewpoint that, as long as no change in the attitude=20
of employer to worker is brought about either by state measures=20
(which for the most part, however, are fruitless) or by a uni=C2=AC=20
versal new education, there remains nothing for the worker to do=20
but stand on his rights as an equal contracting party and defend=20
his own interests in economic life. I further emphasized that=20
safeguarding his interests in this way was entirely compatible=20
with a whole national community if it can prevent social in=C2=AC=20
justices which must subsequently bring about excessive damage=20
to the entire community of a people. I further declared that this=20
necessity must be considered to prevail as long as there exist=20
among employers men who, left to themselves, not only have no=20
feeling for social duties, but not even for the most primitive=20
human rights; and from this I drew the inference that, once=20
such a self-defense is regarded as necessary, its form can reason=C2=AC=20
ably exist only in a grouping of workers on a trade-union basis.=20

And in the year 1922 nothing changed in this general concep=C2=AC=20
tion of mine. But now it was necessary to seek a clear and=20
definite formulation of our attitude toward these problems. It=20
was not acceptable to content ourselves in future with mere=20
knowledge; it was necessary to draw practical inferences from it.=20

We required the answer to the following questions:=20

1. Are trade unions necessary?=20


598=20


Mein Kampe=20


2. Should the NSDAP itself engage in trade-union activity or=20
direct its members to such activity in any form?=20

3. What must be the nature of a National Socialist trade union?=20
What are our tasks and aims?=20

4. How shall we arrive at such unions?=20

I believe that I have adequately answered the first question.=20
As things stand today, the trade unions in my opinion cannot be=20
dispensed with. On the contrary, they are among the most im=C2=AC=20
portant institutions of the nation=E2=80=99s economic life. Their signifi=
=C2=AC=20
cance lies not only in the social and political field, but even more=20
in the general field of national politics. A people whose broad=20
masses, through a sound trade-union movement, obtain the=20
satisfaction of their living requirements and at the same time an=20
education, will be tremendously strengthened in its power of=20
resistance in the struggle for existence.=20

Above all, the trade unions are necessary as foundation stones=20
of the future economic parliament or chambers of estates.=20

The second question , too, is easy to answer. If the trade-union=20
movement is important, it is clear that National Socialism must=20
take a position on it, not only from the purely theoretical, but=20
from the practical viewpoint as well. Yet, to be sure, the how of=20
it is harder to clarify.=20

The National Socialist movement, which envisions the National=20
Socialist folkish state as the aim of its activity, cannot doubt that=20
all future institutions of this state some day to be must grow out=20
of the movement itself. It is the greatest error to believe that=20
suddenly, once we have power, we can undertake a definite re=C2=AC=20
organization out of the void, unless we previously possess a cer=C2=AC=20
tain basic stock of men who above all have been educated with=20
regard to loyalty. Here, too, the principle applies that more im=C2=AC=20
portant than the outward form, which can be created mechani=C2=AC=20
cally and very quickly, remains the spirit which fills such a form.=20
For instance, it is quite possible dictatorially to graft the leader=20
principle on a state organism by command. But it will only be=20
alive if it has gradually taken shape from smallest beginnings=20
in a development of its own, and, by the constant selection which=20


National Socialist Unions=20


599=20


life=E2=80=99s hard reality incessantly performs, has obtained in the cours=
e=20
of many years the leader material necessary for the execution of=20
this principle.=20

And so we must not imagine that we can suddenly pull the=20
plans for a new state form out of a briefcase into the light of day=20
and =E2=80=98introduce=E2=80=99 them by decree from above. Such a thing can=
 be=20
attempted, but the result will surely be incapable of survival, in=20
most cases a stillborn child. This reminds me of the beginning of=20
the Weimar regime and the attempt to present the German=20
people with .not only a new regime, but a new flag which had no=20
inner bond with the experience of our people in the last half=20
century.=20

The National Socialist state must beware of such experiments.=20
It can, when the time comes, only grow out of an organization=20
that has long existed. This organization must possess National=20
Socialist life innate within itself, in order to finally create a=20
living National Socialist state.=20

As already emphasized, the germ cells for the economic cham=C2=AC=20
bers will have to reside in bodies representing the most varied=20
occupations, hence above all in the trade unions. And if this=20
future body representing the estates and the central economic=20
parliament are to constitute a National Socialist institution,=20
these important germ cells must also embody aJNational Socialist=20
attitude and conception. The institutions of the movement are=20
to be transferred to the state, but the state cannot suddenly=20
conjure up the required institutions from the void, unless they=20
are to remain utterly lifeless structures.=20

From this highest standpoint alone, the National Socialist=20
movement must recognize the necessity of a trade-union activity=20
of its own.=20

It must, furthermore, do so because a truly National Socialist=20
education of employers as well as workers, in the sense of an=20
integration of both into the common framework of the national=20
community, does not come about through theoretical instruction,=20
proclamations, or remonstrances, but through the struggle of=20
daily life. In it and through it the movement must educate the=20


600=20


Mein Kampe=20


various great economic groups and bring them closer to one=20
another on the main issues. Without such preliminary work, all=20
hope that a true national community will some day arise remains=20
pure illusion. Only the great philosophical ideal for which the=20
movement fights can slowly form that universal style which will=20
some day make the new era seem really solidly founded within,=20
and not just outwardly manufactured.=20

And so the movement must not only take an affirmative atti=C2=AC=20
tude toward the idea of the trade union as such, but it must by=20
practical participation impart to the multitudes of its 1 members=20
and supporters the necessary education for the coming National=20
Socialist state.=20

The answer to the third question follows from what has previ=C2=AC=20
ously been said.=20

The National Socialist trade union is no organ of class struggle,=20
but an organ for representing occupational interests. The National=20
Socialist state knows no 1 classesbut politically speaking only=20
citizens with absolutely equal rights and accordingly equal general=20
duties, and, alongside of these, state subjects who in the political=20
sense are absolutely without rights.=20

The trade union in the National Socialist sense does not have=20
the function of grouping certain people within a national body=20
and thus gradually transforming them into a class, to take up=20
the fight against other similarly organized formations. We can=20
absolutely not impute this function to the trade union as such;=20
it became so only in the moment when the trade union became=20
the instrument of Marxist struggle. Not the trade union is char=C2=AC=20
acterized by class struggle; Marxism has made it an instrument for=20
the Marxist class struggle. Marxism created the economic weapon=20
which the international world Jew uses for shattering the eco=C2=AC=20
nomic base of the free, independent national states, for the=20
destruction of their national industry and their national com=C2=AC=20
merce, and, accordingly, the enslavement of free peoples in the=20
service of supra-state world finance Jewry.=20

1 This confusion of pronouns exists in the German. Tts=E2=80=99 refers, of =
course,=20
to the trade unions.=20


National Socialist Employers and Workers 601=20

In the face of this , the National Socialist trade union must , by=20
organizationally embracing certain groups of participants in the=20
national economic process , increase the security of the national,=20
economy itself and intensify its strength by the corrective elimination=20
of all those abuses which in their ultimate consequences have a de=C2=AC=20
structive effect on the national body , injure the vital force of the=20
national community , and hence also of the state , and last but not=20
least redound to the wrack and ruin of the economy itself.=20

Hence, for the National Socialist union the strike is not a means=20
for shattering and shaking national production, but for enhanc=C2=AC=20
ing it and making it run smoothly by combating all those abuses=20
which, due to their unsocial character, interfere with the efficiency=20
of the economy and hence the existence of the totality. For the=20
efficiency of the individual always stands in a casual connection=20
with the general legal and social position that he occupies in the=20
economic process and with his understanding, resulting from this=20
alone, of the necessity that this process thrive for his own ad=C2=AC=20
vantage.=20

The National Socialist worker must know that the prosperity of=20
the national economy means his own material happiness.=20

The National Socialist employer must know that the happiness=20
and contentment of his workers is the premise for the existence and=20
development of his own economic greatness.=20

National Socialist workers and National Socialist employers are=20
both servants and guardians of the national community as a whole.=20
The high degree of personal freedom that is granted them in their=20
activity can be explained by the fact that, as experience shows,=20
the efficiency of the individual is increased much more by far-=20
reaching freedom than by compulsion from above, and, further=C2=AC=20
more, it is calculated to prevent the natural process of selection,=20
which advances the most efficient, capable, and industrious from=20
being thwarted.=20

For the National Socialist union, therefore, the strike is an=20
instrument which may and actually must be applied only so long=20
as a National Socialist folkish state does not exist. This state,=20
to be sure, must, in place of the mass struggle of the two great=20


602=20


Mein Kampf=20


groups =E2=80=94 employers and workers =E2=80=94 (which in its consequences=
=20
always injures the national community as a whole by diminishing=20
production) assume the legal care and the legal protection of all.=20
Upon the economic chambers themselves it will be incumbent to=20
keep the national economy functioning and eliminate the de=C2=AC=20
ficiencies and errors which damage it. The things for which=20
millions fight and struggle today must in time be settled in=20
the chambers of estates and the central economic parliament. Then=20
employers and workers will not rage against one another in strug=C2=AC=20
gles over pay and wage scales, damaging the economic existence=20
of both, but solve these problems jointly in a higher instance,=20
which must above all constantly envision the welfare of the=20
people as a whole and of the state, in gleaming letters.=20

Here, too, as everywhere, the iron principle must prevail that=20
first comes the fatherland and then the party.=20

The function of the National Socialist union is the education=20
and preparation for this aim itself, which is: All working together=20
for the preservation and safeguarding of our people and our state ,=20
in accordance with the abilities and strength innate in the individual=20
and trained by the national community.=20

The fourth question: How do we arrive at such unions? seemed=20
at the time by far the hardest to answer.=20

It is in general easier to found an institution on new soil than=20
in an old territory that already possesses a similar institution. In=20
a town where no store of a certain type is present, it is easy to=20
establish such a store. It is harder when a similar enterprise=20
already is present, and hardest of all when the conditions are=20
such that only one alone can prosper. For here the founders face=20
the task of not only introducing their own business, but they=20
must, in order to exist, destroy the one that has previously=20
existed in the town.=20

A National Socialist union side by side with other unions is=20
senseless. For it, too, must feel itself permeated by its philo=C2=AC=20
sophical task and the resultant obligation to be intolerant of=20
other similar, let alone hostile, formations and to emphasize the=20
exclusive necessity of its own ego. Here, too, there is no under-=20


No Dual Unions=20


603=20


standing and no compromise with related efforts, but only the=20
maintenance of our absolute sole right.=20

There were two ways of arriving at such a development:=20

(1) We could found a trade union and then gradually take up the=20
struggle against the international Marxist unions; or we could=20

(2) penetrate the Marxist unions and try to fill them with the=20
new spirit; in other words, transform them into instruments of=20
the new ideology.=20

To the first method there were the following objections: Our=20
financial difficulties at that time were still very considerable,=20
the means that stood at our disposal were quite insignificant..=20
The gradually and increasingly spreading inflation made the=20
situation even more difficult, since in those years one could hardly=20
have spoken of any tangible benefit to the member from the trade=20
union. The individual worker, viewed from his own standpoint,=20
had no ground at that time to pay dues to the union. Even the=20
already existing Marxist unions were on the point of collapse=20
until suddenly, through Herr Cuno=E2=80=99s brilliant Ruhr action, the=20
millions fell into their lap. This so-called =E2=80=98national=E2=80=99 cha=
ncellor=20
may be designated as the savior of the Marxist unions.=20

At that time we could not count on such financial possibilities;=20
and it could allure no one to enter a new union which, owing to=20
its financial impotence, could not have offered him the least=20
benefit. On the other hand, I must sharply oppose creating such=20
an organization as a soft spot for more or less great minds to take=20
refuge in.=20

All in all, the question of personalities played one of the most=20
important parts. At that time I had not a single personality=20
whom I would have held capable of solving this gigantic task.=20
Anyone who at that time would really have shattered the Marxist=20
unions , and in place of this institution of destructive class struggle ,=
=20
helped the National Socialist trade-union idea to victory , was among=20
the very great men of our people , and his bust would some day have=20
had to be dedicated to posterity in the Valhalla at Regensburg.=20

But I did not know of any head that would have fitted such a=20
pedestal.=20


604=20


Mein Kampf=20


It is absolutely wrong to be diverted from this view by the fact=20
that the international trade unions themselves have only average=20
minds at their disposal. This in reality means nothing at ail;=20
for at the time when they were founded, there was nothing else.=20
Today the National Socialist movement must combat a colossal=20
gigantic organization which has long been in existence, and which=20
is developed down to the slightest detail. The conqueror must=20
always be more astute than the defender if he wants to subdue=20
him. The Marxist trade-union fortress can today be administered=20
by ordinary bosses; but it will only be stormed by the wild energy=20
and shining ability of an outstanding great man on the other side.=20
If such a man is not found, it is useless to argue with Fate and=20
even more useless to attempt forcing the matter with inadequate=20
substitutes.=20

Here we must apply the maxim that in life it is sometimes better=20
to let a thing lie for the present than to begin it badly or by=20
halves for want of suitable forces.=20

There was also another consideration which should not be=20
designated as demagogic. I had at that time and still possess=20
today the unshakable conviction that it is dangerous to tie up a=20
great politico-philosophical struggle with economic matters at=20
too early a time. This is particularly true with our German=20
people. For here, in such a case, the economic struggle will at=20
once withdraw the energy from the political struggle. Once=20
people have won the conviction that by thrift they can acquire=20
a little house, they will dedicate themselves only to this task and=20
will have no more time to spare for the political struggle against=20
those who are planning to take away their saved-up pennies some=20
day in one way or another. Instead of fighting in the political=20
struggle for the insight and conviction they have won, they give=20
themselves up entirely to their idea of =E2=80=98 settlement/ and in the=20
end as a rule find themselves holding the bag.=20

The National Socialist movement today stands at the begin=C2=AC=20
ning of its struggle. In large part it has still to form and complete=20
its philosophical picture. It must fight with all the fiber of its=20
energy for the accomplishment of its great ideas, and success=20


The Philosophical Struggle Comes First 605=20


is thinkable only if all its strength goes completely into the=20
service of this fight.=20

To what an extent concern with purely economic problems can=20
paralyze active fighting strength, we can see at this very moment=20
in a classical example:=20

The revolution of November , 1918, was not made by trade unions ,=20
but was accomplished against them. And the German bourgeoisie=20
is carrying on no political struggle for the German future because it=20
believes this future to be sufficiently guaranteed by the constructive=20
work in the economic sphere.=20

We should learn from such experiences; for it would be no=20
different with us. The more we muster the entire strength of our=20
movement for the political struggle, the sooner may we count=20
on success all along the line; but the more we prematurely burden=20
ourselves with trade-union, settlement, and similar problems, the=20
smaller will be the benefit for our cause taken as a whole. For=20
important as these matters may be, their fulfillment will only=20
occur on a large scale, when we are in a position to put the state=20
power into the service of these ideas. Until then, these problems=20
would paralyze the movement all the mbre, the sooner it con=C2=AC=20
cerned itself with them and the more its philosophical will was=20
limited by them. Then it might easily come about that trade-union=20
motives would guide the movement instead of the philosophy forcing=20
the trade union into its channels.=20

Real benefit for the movement as well as our people can only arise=20
from a trade-union movement , if philosophically this movement is=20
already so strongly filled with our National Socialist ideas that it no=20
longer runs the risk of falling into Marxist tracks. For a trade-union=20
movement which sees its mission only in competition with the Marx=C2=AC=20
ist unions would be worse than none at all. It must declare war=20
on the Marxist union, not only as an organization , but above all=20
as an idea. In the Marxist union it must strike down the herald=20
of the class struggle and the class idea and in its stead must be=C2=AC=20
come the protector of the occupational interests of German=20
citizens.=20

All these criteria then,argued and still argue against the foun-=20


606=20


Mein Kampe=20


elation of our own trade unions, unless suddenly a man should=20
appear who is obviously chosen by Fate for the solution of this=20
very question.=20

And so there were only two other possibilities: either to=20
recommend that our own party comrades leave the unions, or=20
that they remain in them and work as destructively as possible.=20

In general I recommended this latter way.=20

Especially in the year 1922-23 this could be done without=20
difficulty; for the financial benefit which during the inflation=20
period accrued to the trade union from our members in their=20
ranks, who due to the youth of our movement were not yet very=20
numerous, 'was practically nil. But the damage to it was very=20
great, for the National Socialist supporters were its sharpest=20
critics and thus its inner disrupters.=20

At that time I totally rejected all experiments which contained=20
the seeds of failure to begin with. I would have viewed it as a=20
crime to take so and so much of a worker=E2=80=99s meager earnings for=20
an institution of whose benefit to its members I was at heart not=20
convinced.=20

If one fine day a new political party disappears, it is scarcely=20
ever a loss but almost always a benefit, and no one has any right=20
to moan about it; for what the individual gives to a political=20
movement, he gives afonds perdu. But anyone who pays money=20
into a union has a right to the fulfillment of the promised return=20
services. If this is not taken into account, the leaders of such a=20
union are swindlers, or at least frivolous characters who must be=20
called to account.=20

And in 1922 we acted according to this view. Others thought=20
they knew better and founded trade unions. They attacked our=20
lack of unions as the most visible sign of our mistaken and limited=20
views. But it was not long before these organizations themselves=20
vanished, so that the final result was the same as with us. Only=20
with the one difference, that we had deceived neither ourselves=20
nor others.=20

German Alliance Policy After the War=20


T=20

JL he heedlessness of the leaders of the=20
Reich=E2=80=99s foreign policy when it came to establishing basic princi=C2=
=AC=20
ples for an expedient alliance policy was not only continued=20
after the revolution but was even exceeded. For if before the=20
War general confusion of political concepts could be regarded as=20
the cause of our faulty leadership in foreign policy, after the=20
War it was a lack of honorable intentions. It was natural that=20
the circles who saw their destructive aims finally achieved by=20
the revolution could possess no interest in an alliance policy=20
whose final result would inevitably be the re-establishment of a=20
free German state. Not only that such a development would=20
have run counter to the inner sense of the November crime, not=20
only that it would have interrupted or actually ended the inter=C2=AC=20
nationalization of the German economy: but also the domestic=20
political effects resulting from a victorious fight for freedom in=20
the field of foreign policy would in the future have meant doom=20
for the present holders of power in the Reich. For the resurrec=C2=AC=20
tion of a nation is not conceivable without its preceding na=C2=AC=20
tionalization, as, conversely, every great success in the sphere of=20
foreign affairs inevitably produces reactions in the same direc=C2=AC=20
tion. Every fight for freedom, as experience shows, leads to an=20
intensification of national sentiment, of self-reliance, and hence=20
also to a sharper sensibility toward anti-national elements and=20




608=20


Mein Kampf=20


tendencies. Conditions and persons who are tolerated in peace=C2=AC=20
able times, who often, in fact, pass unnoticed, are not only re=C2=AC=20
buffed in times of seething national enthusiasm, but encounter a=20
resistance that is not seldom fatal to them. Just recall, for ex=C2=AC=20
ample, the general fear of spies which at the outbreak of wars=20
suddenly bursts forth in the fever heat of human passions and=20
leads to the most brutal, sometimes even unjust persecutions,=20
though everyone might tell himself that the danger of spies will=20
be greater in the long years of a peaceful period, even though, for=20
obvious reasons, it does not receive general attention to the same=20
extent.=20

For this' reason alone the subtle instinct of the government=20
parasites washed to the surface by the November events senses=20
that an uprising of our people for freedom, supported by an=20
intelligent alliance policy and the resultant outburst of national=20
passions, would mean the possible end of their own criminal=20
existence.=20

Thus, it becomes understandable why the government authori=C2=AC=20
ties in power since 1918 have failed us in the field of foreign=20
affairs and why the leaders of the state have almost always=20
worked systematically against the real interests of the German=20
nation. For what at first sight might appear planless is revealed=20
on closer examination as merely the logical continuation of the=20
road which the November revolution for the first time openly=20
trod.=20

Here, to be sure, we must distinguish between the responsible=20
or rather =E2=80=98 should-be-responsible =E2=80=99 leaders of our state af=
fairs, the=20
average parliamentary politicasters, and the great stupid sheep=E2=80=99s=
=20
herd of patient lamblike people.=20

The first know what they want. The others play along, either=20
because they know it or are too cowardly to ruthlessly oppose=20
what they have recognized and felt to be harmful. And the others=20
submit from incomprehension and stupidity.=20

As long as the National Socialist German Workers=E2=80=99 Party pos=C2=AC=
=20
sessed only the scope of a small and little known club, problems=20
of foreign policy could possess only a subordinate importance in=20


Aim of Foreign Policy=20


609=20


the eyes of many adherents. This especially because our move=C2=AC=20
ment in particular has always upheld and must always uphold=20
the conception that external freedom comes neither as a gift=20
from heaven nor from earthly powers, but can only be the fruit=20
of development of inner strength. Only the elimination of the=20
causes of our collapse , as well as the destruction of its beneficiaries ,=
=20
can create the premise for our outward fight for freedom.=20

And so it is understandable if, due to such considerations, in=20
the first period of the young movement the value of questions of=20
foreign policy was set below the importance of its domestic reform=20
plans.=20

But once the limits of the small, insignificant club were broad=C2=AC=20
ened and finally broken, and the young formation obtained the=20
importance of a big organization, the necessity arose of taking a=20
position on the questions pertaining to the developments in=20
foreign affairs. It became necessary to lay down guiding princi=C2=AC=20
ples which would not only not contradict the fundamental views=20
of our world concept, but actually represent an emanation of=20
this line of thought.=20

Precisely from our people=E2=80=99s lack of schooling .in foreign affairs,=
=20
there results for the young movement an obligation to transmit=20
to the individual leaders as well as the great masses through broad=20
guiding principles a line of thought in matters of foreign policy,=20
which is the premise for any practical execution in the future=20
of the preparations in the field of foreign policy for the work of=20
recovering the freedom of our people as well as a real sovereignty=20
of the Reich.=20

The essential fundamental and guiding principle, which we=20
must always bear in mind in judging this question, is that foreign=20
policy is only a means to an end, and that the end is solely the=20
promotion of our own nationality. No consideration of foreign=20
policy can proceed from any other criterion than this: Does it=20
benefit our nationality now or in the future , or will it be injurious=20
to it?=20

This is the sole preconceived opinion 1 permissible in dealing=20

1 1 die einzige vorgetasste Meinung .. ?=20


610=20


Mein Kampe=20


with this question. Partisan, religious, humanitarian, and all=20
other criteria in general, are completely irrelevant.=20

If before the War the task of a German foreign policy was to=20
safeguard the sustenance of our people and its children on this=20
globe by the preparation of the roads that can lead to this goal,=20
as well as the winning of the necessary helpers in the form of=20
expedient allies, today it is the same, with the single difference:=20
Before the War, it was a question of helping to preserve the German=20
nationality, taking into account the existing strength of the inde=C2=AC=20
pendent power state, today it is necessary first to restore to the nation=
=20
its strength in the form of a free power state, which is the premise for=20
the subsequent implementation of a practical foreign policy which=20
will preserve, promote, and sustain our people for the future.=20

In other words: The aim of a German foreign policy of=20
today must he the preparation for the reconquest of free=C2=AC=20
dom for tomorrow.=20

And here a fundamental principle must always be kept in=20
mind: The possibility of regaining independence for a nationality is=20
not absolutely bound up with the integrity of a state territory, but=20
rather with the existence of a remnant, even though small, of this=20
people and state, which, in possession of the necessary freedom, not=20
only can embody the spiritual community of the whole nationality,=20
but also can prepare the military fight for freedom.=20

When a nation of a hundred million people, in order to preserve=20
its state integrity, suffers the yoke of slavery in common, it is=20
worse than if such a state and such a people had been shattered=20
and only a part of them remained in possession of full freedom.=20
On condition, to be sure, that 5 this last remnant were filled with=20
the holy mission of not only proclaiming its spiritual and cul=C2=AC=20
tural inseparability, but also of accomplishing the military prepa=C2=AC=20
ration for the final liberation and reunion of the unfortunate=20
oppressed portions.=20


Faulty Continental Policy Before the War 611=20

It should further he borne in mind that the question of regaining=20
lost sections of a people's and state's territory is always primarily=20
a question of regaining the political power and independence of the=20
mother country; that , therefore , in such a case the interests of lost=20
territories must he ruthlessly subordinated to the interest of regaining=20
the freedom of the main territory. For the liberation of oppressed ,=20
separated splinters of a nationality or of provinces of a country does=20
not take place on the basis of a desire on the part of the oppressed=20
people or of a protest on the part of those left behind , but through=20
the implements of power of those remnants of the former common=20
fatherland that are still more or less sovereign.=20

Therefore, the presupposition for the gaining of lost territories=20
is the intensive promotion and strengthening of the remaining=20
remnant state and the unshakable decision slumbering in the=20
heart to dedicate the new force thus arising to the freedom and=20
unification of the entire nationality in the proper hour: therefore,=20
subordination of the interests of the separated territories to the=20
single interest of winning for the remaining remnant that measure=20
of political power and strength which is the precondition for a=20
correction of the will of hostile victors. For oppressed territories=20
are led back to the bosom of a common Reich , not by flaming protests ,=20
but by a mighty sword.=20

To forge this sword is the task of a country's internal political=20
leadership; to safeguard the work of forging and seek comrades in=20
arms is the function of diplomatic leadership .=20

In the first volume of this work I have discussed the half=C2=AC=20
heartedness of our alliance policy before the War. Of the four=20
roads to a future preservation of our nationality and its suste=C2=AC=20
nance, the fourth and least favorable was chosen. In place of a=20
healthy European land policy, a colonial and commercial policy=20
was chosen. This was all the more fallacious as it was thought=20
that an armed settlement could in this way be avoided. The=20


612=20


Mein Kampf=20


result of this attempt to sit on several chairs was the proverbial=20
f all between them, and the World War was only the last=20
reckoning submitted the Reich for its faulty conduct of foreign=20
affairs.=20

The correct road would even then have been the third: a=20
strengthening of our continental power by gaining new soil in=20
Europe , and precisely this seemed to place a completion by later=20
acquisitions of colonial territory within the realm of the naturally=20
possible. This policy, to be sure, could only have been carried=20
out in alliance with England or with so abnormal an emphasis=20
on the military implements of power that for forty or fifty years=20
cultural tasks would have been forced into the background.=20
This would have been quite justifiable. The cultural importance=20
of a nation is almost always bound up with its political freedom=20
and independence; therefore, the latter is the presupposition for=20
the existence, or, better, the establishment, of the former. There=C2=AC=20
fore, no sacrifice can be too great for the securing of political=20
freedom. What general cultural matters lose through an exces=C2=AC=20
sive promotion of the state=E2=80=99s implements of military power, it=20
will later be possible to restore most abundantly. Yes, it may=20
be said that, after such a concentrated exertion in the sole direc=C2=AC=20
tion of preserving state independence, a certain relaxation or=20
compensation customarily ensues in the form of a really amazing=20
golden age of the hitherto neglected cultural forces of a nation.=20
From the hardships of the Persian Wars arose the Age of Pericles,=20
and through the cares of the Punic Wars the Roman state began=20
to dedicate itself to the service of a higher culture.=20

To be sure, such a complete subordination of all a nation=E2=80=99s=20
other interests to the sole task of preparing a coming contest of=20
arms for the future security of the state cannot be entrusted to=20
the decision of a majority of parliamentary idiots or good-for-=20
nothings. The father of a Frederick the Great was able to pre=C2=AC=20
pare for a contest of arms, disregarding all other concerns, but=20
the fathers of our democratic parliamentary nonsense of the=20
Jewish variety cannot do so.=20

For this very reason the military preparation for an acquisi-=20

tion of land and soil in Europe could be only a limited one, and=20
the support of suitable allies could hardly be dispensed with.=20

Since, however, our leaders wanted to know nothing of a sys=C2=AC=20
tematic preparation for war, they renounced the acquisition of=20
land in Europe and, by turning instead to a colonial and com=C2=AC=20
mercial policy, sacrificed the alliance with England which would=20
otherwise have been possible, but did not, as would have been=20
logical, seek the support of Russia, and finally, forsaken by all=20
except the Habsburg hereditary evil, stumbled into the World=20

In characterizing our present foreign policy, it must be said=20
that there exists no visible or even intelligible line. Before the=20
War the fourth road was erroneously taken, and that pursued=20
only by halves, while since the revolution no road at all has been=20
discernible, even to the sharpest eye. Even more than before=20
the War, any systematic thought is lacking, except perhaps an=20
attempt to smash the last possibility of a resurrection of our=20
people.=20

A cool appraisal of the present European relations of power=20
leads to the following conclusion:=20

For three hundred years the history of our continent has been=20
basically determined by the attempt of England to obtain the=20
necessary protection in the rear for great British aims in world=20
politics, indirectly through balanced, mutually interlocking rela=C2=AC=20
tions of power.=20

The traditional tendency of British diplomacy, which in=20
Germany can only be compared with the tradition of the Prussian=20
army, was, since the efforts of Queen Elizabeth, directed solely=20
toward preventing by all possible means the rise of any European=20
great power above its place in the general hierarchy, and, if=20
possible, to break it by military intervention. The instruments=20
of power which England was accustomed to apply in this case=20


614=20


Mein Kampf=20


varied according to the existing or presented task; 1 but the de=C2=AC=20
termination and will power for using them were always the same.=20
Indeed, the more difficult England=E2=80=99s situation became in the=20
course of time, the more necessary it seemed to the leaders of=20
the British Empire to keep the individual state powers of Europe=20
in a state of general paralysis resulting from mutual rivalries.=20
The political separation of the former North American colonial=20
territory led, in the ensuing period, to the greatest exertions to=20
keep the European rear absolutely covered. And so =E2=80=94 after the=20
destruction of Spain and the Netherlands as great sea powers =E2=80=94=20
the strength of the English was concentrated against aspiring=20
France until finally, with the fall of Napoleon, the danger to=20
England of this most dangerous military power=E2=80=99s hegemony=20
could be regarded as broken.=20

The shift of British policy against Germany was undertaken=20
only slowly, not only because, due to the lack of a national uni=C2=AC=20
fication of the German nation, a visible danger for England did=20
not exist, but also because public opinion, prepared by propa=C2=AC=20
ganda for a particular political goal, is slow in following new aims.=20
The sober knowledge of the statesman seems transposed into=20
emotional values which are not only more fruitful in their mo=C2=AC=20
mentary efficacy, but also more stable with regard to duration.=20
Therefore the statesman, after achieving one purpose, can with=C2=AC=20

but it will be possible to transform the masses emotionally into=20

new position. Fluctuations which occurred at times, due to the=20
importance of America in world economy as well as Russia=E2=80=99s=20
development as a political power, were unfortunately not utilized=20
by Germany, so that a steady intensification of the original tend=C2=AC=20
ency in British statesmanship was bound to result.=20

England saw in Germany the power whose importance in=20
commercial and hence in world politics, not least as a result of=20
her enormous industrialization, was increasing to such a menac=C2=AC=20
ing extent that the strength of the two states in identical fields=20
could already be balanced. The * peaceful , economic =E2=80=99 conquest=20
of the world which to the helmsmen of our state seemed the=20
highest emanation of the ultimate wisdom, became for the=20
English politicians the ground for the organization of resistance=20
against us. That this resistance assumed the form of a compre=C2=AC=20
hensively organized attack was fully in keeping with the essence=20
of a diplomacy whose aims did not lie in the preservation of a=20
questionable world peace , but in the reinforcement of British=20
world domination . That England used as allies all states which=20
were in any way possible in the military sense was equally in=20
keeping with her traditional caution in the estimation of the=20
adversary=E2=80=99s strength as with the appreciation of her own momen=C2=
=AC=20
tary weakness. This can, therefore, not be characterized as=20
1 unscrupulousness,=E2=80=99 because such a comprehensive organization=20
of a war is to be judged by criteria, not of heroism, but of ex=C2=AC=20
pediency. Diplomacy must see to it that a people does not heroically=20
perish , but is practically preserved. Every road that leads to this is=20
then expedient , and not taking it must be characterized as criminal=20
neglect of duty.=20

With the revolutionization of Germany, the British concern=20
over a threatening Germanic world hegemony found an end, to=20
the relief of British statesmen.=20

Since then England has had no further interest in the complete=20
effacement of Germany from the map of Europe. On the con=C2=AC=20

For four and a half years the British world empire had fought=20
in order to break the supposed preponderance of a continental=20
power. Now suddenly a crash occurred which seemed to remove=20
this power entirely from the picture. There was manifested such=20
an absence of even the most primitive instinct of self-preserva=C2=AC=20
tion that the European balance seemed thrown off its hinges by=20
an action of scarcely forty-eight hours: Germany destroyed and=20
France the first continental power of Europe .=20

The enormous propaganda which had made the British people=20
persevere and hold out in this war, which recklessly incited them=20
and stirred up all their deepest instincts and passions, now inev=C2=AC=20
itably weighed like lead on the decisions of British statesmen.=20
With the colonial, economic, and commercial destruction of=20
Germany, the British war aim was achieved; anything beyond=20
this was a curtailment of English interests. Through- wiping out=20
a German power state in continental Europe, only the enemies of=20
England could gain. Nevertheless, in the November days of=20
1918 and up to midsummer of 1919, a reorientation of English=20
diplomacy, which in this long war more than ever before had used=20
up the emotional powers of the great masses, was no longer pos=C2=AC=20
sible. It was not possible from the viewpoint of the existing atti=C2=AC=20
tude of their own people, and was not possible in view of the=20
disposition of the military relation of 1 forces. France had seized=20
upon the law of action 1 and could dictate to the others. The=20
single power, however, which in these months of haggling and=20
bargaining might have brought about a change, Germany herself,=20

Actually England did not achieve her war aim. The rise of a=20
European power above the relations of forces of the continental=20
state system of Europe was not only not prevented but was given=20
increased support.=20

In 1914, Germany as a military state was wedged in between=20
two countries one of which disposed of an equal power and the=20
other of a superior power. On top of this came the superior sea=20
power of England; France and Russia alone offered obstacles=20
and resistance to every disproportionate development of German=20
greatness. The extremely unfavorable situation of the Reich=20
from the viewpoint of military geography could be considered a=20
further coefficient of security against an excessive increase in the=20
power of this country. The coastline especially was unfavorable=20
from the military standpoint for a fight with England; it was=20
short and cramped, and the land front, on the other hand, dis=C2=AC=20
proportionately long and open.=20

The situation of France today is different: the first military=20
power, without a serious rival on the continent; on her southern=20
borders, as good as guaranteed against Spain and Italy; secured=20
against Germany by the feebleness of the fatherland; her coast=C2=AC=20
line on a long front poised directly opposite the vital nerves of=20
the British Empire. Not only for airplanes and long-distance=20
batteries do the English vital centers constitute worth-while=20
targets, but also her trade lanes are exposed to the effects of=20
submarine warfare. A submarine campaign, based on the long=20
Atlantic coast and the equally long stretches of the French=20
border territories of the Mediterranean in Europe and North=20
Africa, would be devastating in effect.=20

Thus, the fruit of the struggle against the development of Germany's=20
power was politically to bring about French hegemony on the con=C2=AC=20
tinent. The military result: the reinforcement of France as the first=20
prime power on land and the recognition of the Union as an equal=20
sea power. Economically: the surrender of immense spheres of=20
British interest to former allies.=20

Anyone who undertakes an examination of the present alliance=20
possibilities for Germany from the above standpoint must arrive=20
at the conclusion that the last practicable tie remains with=20
England. Terrible as the consequences of the English war policy=20
were and are for Germany, we must not close our eyes to the=20
fact that a necessary interest on the part of England in the=20
annihilation of Germany no longer exists today', that, on the=20
contrary, England=E2=80=99s policy from year to year must be directed=20
more and more to an obstruction of France=E2=80=99s unlimited drive for=20
hegemony. An alliance policy is not conducted from the stand=C2=AC=20
point of retrospective grudges, but is fructified by the knowledge=20
of retrospective experience. And experience should have taught=20
us that alliances for the achievement of negative aims languish=20
from inner weakness. National destinies are firmly forged together=20
only by the prospect of a common success in the sense of common=20
gains, conquests; in short, of a mutual extension of power.=20

How feebly our people think in terms of foreign policy can be=20
seen most clearly from the current press reports with regard to=20
the greater or lesser =E2=80=98 friendliness to Germany=E2=80=99 of this or=
 that=20

Alliance Possibilities for Germany=20


619=20


benevolent policy toward our nationality in this supposed atti=C2=AC=20
tude on the part of such personalities. This is an utterly incred=C2=AC=20
ible absurdity, a speculation on the unparalleled simplicity of=20
the average German shopkeeper dabbling in politics. No English=20
or American or Italian statesman was ever =E2=80=98 pro-German.=E2=80=99 As=
 a=20
statesman, every Englishman will naturally be even more of an=20
Englishman , every American an American , and no Italian will be=20
found ready to pursue any other policy than a pro-Italian one.=20
Therefore, anyone who thinks he can base alliances with foreign=20
nations on a pro-German orientation of their leading statesmen=20
is either an ass or a hypocrite. The premise for the linking of=20
national destinies is never based on mutual respect , let alone=20
affection , but on the prospect of expediency for both contracting=20
parties. In other words: true as it is that an English statesman=20
will always pursue a pro-English policy and never a pro-German=20
one, certain definite interests of this pro-English policy may for=20
the most varying reasons coincide with pro-German interests.=20
This, of course, need only be the case up to a certain degree=20
and can some day shift to the exact opposite; hut the skill of a=20
leading statesman is manifested precisely in always finding at=20
specified periods those partners for the achievement of their own=20
needs , who must go the same road in pursuit of their own interests .=20

The practical moral of all this for the present can result only=20
from the answer to the following questions: What states at the=20
present time have no vital interest in having the French economic=20
and military power achieve a position of dominant hegemony in=20
Europe hy the total exclusion of a German Central Europe? Yes ,=20
which states on the basis of their own requirements for existence and=20
their previous political tradition see a threat to their own future in=20
such a development?=20

For on this point we must at length achieve full clarity: The=20
inexorable mortal enemy of the German people is and remains=20
France. It matters not at all who ruled or will rule in France,=20
whetner Bourbons or Jacobins, Bonapartists or bourgeois demo=C2=AC=20

possession of the Rhine border and to secure this watercourse for=20
France by means of a dismembered and shattered Germany.=20

England desires no Germany as a world power , but France wishes=20

all! Today we are not fighting for a position as a world power;=20
today we must struggle for the existence of our fatherland , for the=20
unity of our nation and the daily bread of our children . If we look=20
about us for European allies from this standpoint, there remain=20
only two states: England and Italy .=20

England does not want a France whose military fist, unob=C2=AC=20
structed by the rest of Europe, can undertake a policy which, one=20
way or another, must one day cross English interests. England=20
can never desire a France which, in possession of the immense=20
Western European iron and coal deposits, obtains the founda=C2=AC=20
tions of a menacing economic world position. And England,=20
furthermore, cannot desire a France whose continental political=20
situation, thanks to the shattering of the rest of Europe, seems=20
so assured that the resumption of a French world policy along=20
broader lines is not only made possible but positively forced.=20
The Zeppelin bombs of former times might multiply a thousand=C2=AC=20
fold every night; the military preponderance of France presses=20
heavy on the heart of Great Britain=E2=80=99s world empire.=20

And Italy, too, cannot and will not desire a further reinforce=C2=AC=20
ment of the French position of superior power in Europe. Italy=E2=80=99s=20
future will always be conditioned by a development which is=20
geographically grouped around the Mediterranean basin. 1 What=20
drove Italy into the war was really not the desire to aggrandize=20
France, but the desire to give the hated Adriatic rival the death=20
blow. Any further continental strengthening of France, how=C2=AC=20

ourselves that relations of parentage among nations can in any=20

# # #=20

We must, to be sure, in judging such a possibility of alliance,=20
not overlook three factors. The first depends on us, the two=20
others on the states in question.=20

Can any nation ally itself with the present-day Germany? Can a=20
power which seeks in an alliance an aid for carrying out offensive=20
aims of its own, ally itself with a state whose leaders for years=20
have offered a picture of the most wretched incompetence, of=20
pacifistic cowardice, and the greater part of whose population,=20
in democratic-Marxist blindness, betray the interests of their=20
own nation and country in a way that cries to high Heaven?=20
Can any power hope today to create a valuable relation with a=20
state, in the hope of some day fighting in common for common=20
interests, when this country obviously possesses neither the=20
courage nor the desire to stir so much as a finger in defense of its=20
own bare existence? Will any power, for which an alliance is=20
and should be more than a treaty for the guaranty and mainte=C2=AC=20

obligate itself for weal or woe to a state whose characteristic=20
way of life consists only in cringing submissiveness without and=20
disgraceful oppression of national virtues within; with a state=20
that no longer possesses any greatness, since on the basis of its=20
whole behavior it no longer deserves it; with governments which=20
can boast of no respect whatsoever on the part of their citizens,=20
so that foreign countries cannot possibly harbor any greater=20
admiration for them?=20

No, a power which itself wants to be respected and which=20
hopes to gain more from alliances than fees for hungry parlia=C2=AC=20
mentarians will not ally itself with present-day Germany; in=C2=AC=20
deed, it cannot. And in our present unfitness for alliance lies the=20


622=20


Mein Kampf=20


deepest and ultimate ground for the solidarity of the enemy bandits.=20
Since Germany never defends herself, except by a few flaming=20
protests on the part of our parliamentary elite, and the rest of=20
the world has no reason for fighting in our defense, and as a=20
matter of principle God does not make cowardly nations free =E2=80=94=E2=96=
=A0=20
notwithstanding the whimpering of our patriotic leagues to that=20
effect =E2=80=94 there remains nothing else even for the states which=20
possess no direct interest in our total annihilation but to take=20
part in France=E2=80=99s campaigns of pillage, if only, by such cooperation=
=20
and participation in the pillage, at least to prevent the exclusive=20
strengthening of France alone.=20

Secondly, we must not overlook the difficulty in undertaking=20
a reorientation of the great popular masses of the countries previ=C2=AC=20
ously hostile to us, who have been influenced in a certain direc=C2=AC=20
tion by mass propaganda. For it is not possible to-represent a=20

Vandals,=E2=80=99 etc., over a period=20
of years, only to discover the opposite suddenly overnight , and=20
recommend the former enemy as the ally of tomorrow.=20

Yet even more attention must be given to a third fact which=20
will be of essential importance for -the shaping of the coming=20
European alliance relations:=20

Little interest as England, from a British state viewpoint,=20
may have in a further annihilation of Germany, that of the inter=C2=AC=20
national stock exchange Jews in such a development is great.=20
The cleavage between the official, or, better expressed, the tradi=C2=AC=20
tional, British statesmanship and the controlling Jewish stock=20
exchange powers is nowhere better shown than in their different=20
position on the questions of British foreign policy. Jewish finance=20
in opposition to the interests of the British state welfare desires not=20
only the complete economic annihilation of Germany , but also her=20
complete political enslavement. The internationalization of our=20
German economy =E2=80=94 that is, the appropriation of the German=20
labor power by Jewish world finance =E2=80=94 can be completely car=C2=AC=

ried out only in a politically Bolshe vist state. But if the Marxist=20
shock troops of international Jewish stock exchange capital are=20
to break the back of the German national state for good and all.=20


Jewish World Agitation Against Germany 623=20

this can only be done with friendly aid from outside. The armies=20
of France must, therefore, besiege the German state structure=20
until the Reich, inwardly exhausted, succumbs to the Bolshevistic=20
shock troop of international Jewish world finance.=20

And so the Jew today is the great agitator for the complete destruc=C2=AC=
=20
tion of Germany. Wherever in the world we read of attacks against=20
Germany , Jews are their fabricators , just as in peacetime and=20
during the War the press of the Jewish stock exchange and Marxists=20
systematically stirred up haired against Germany until state after=20
state abandoned neutrality and , renouncing the true interests of the=20
peoples , entered the service of the World War coalition.=20

The Jewish train of thought in all this is clear. The Bolshevi-=20
zation of Germany =E2=80=94 that is, the extermination of the national=20
folkish Jewish intelligentsia to make possible the sweating of the=20
German working class under the yoke of Jewish world finance =E2=80=94=20
is conceived only as a preliminary to the further extension of this=20
Jewish tendency of world conquest. As often in history, Ger=C2=AC=20
many is the great pivot in the mighty struggle. If our people and=20
our state become the victim of these bloodthirsty and avaricious=20
Jewish tyrants of nations, the whole earth will sink into the=20
snares of this octopus; if Germany frees herself from this em=C2=AC=20
brace, this greatest of dangers to nations may be regarded as=20
broken for the whole world.=20

Therefore, as surely as the Jews will bring their entire agita=C2=AC=20
tional efforts to bear, not only to maintain the hostility of the=20
nations to Germany, but if possible to increase it even more,=20
just as surely only a fraction of this activity coincides with the=20
real interests of the peoples poisoned by it. In general , the Jews=20
will always fight within the various national bodies with those=20
weapons which on the basis of the recognized mentality of these=20
nations seem most effective and promise the greatest success. In=20
our national body, so torn with regard to blood, it is therefore=20
the more or less =E2=80=98 cosmopolitan/ pacifistic-ideological ideas, aris=

short, they always utilize the most essential qualities that char=C2=AC=20
acterize the mentality of a people. Only when in such a way they=20
have achieved a certain profusion of economic and political in=C2=AC=20
fluence and predominance do they strip off the fetters of these=20
borrowed weapons, and display in exactly the same measure the=20
true inner purposes of their will and their struggle. They now=20
begin to destroy with ever-greater rapidity, until they have=20
turned one state after another into a heap of rubble on which=20
they can then establish the sovereignty of the eternal Jewish=20
empire.=20

In England as well as Italy the cleavage between the views of the=20
better indigenous statesmanship and the will of the world stock ex=C2=AC=20
change Jews is clear; sometimes, indeed, it is crassly obvious.=20

Only in France does there exist today more than ever an inner=20
unanimity between the intentions of the Jew-controlled stock=20
exchange and the desire of the chauvinist-minded national states=C2=AC=20
men. But in this very identity there lies an immense danger for=20
Germany. For this very reason, France is and remains by far=20
the most terrible enemy. This people, which is basically becoming=20
more and more negrified, constitutes in its tie with the aims of=20
Jewish world domination an enduring danger for the existence of=20
the white race in Europe. For the contamination by Negro blood=20
on the Rhine in the heart of Europe is just as much in keeping=20
with the perverted sadistic thirst for vengeance of this hereditary=20
enemy of our people as is the ice-cold calculation of the Jew thus=20
to begin bastardizing the European continent at its core and to=20
deprive the white race of the foundations for a sovereign exist=C2=AC=20
ence through infection with lower humanity.=20

What France , spurred on by her own thirst for vengeance and=20
systematically led by the Jew, is doing in Europe today is a sin=20
against the existence of white humanity and some day will incite=20
against this people all the avenging spirits of a race which has recog=C2=

Here I must recall a special hobby which in these years the Jew=20
rode with amazing adroitness: the South Tyrol .=20

Yes, the South Tyrol. If I here concern myself with this par=C2=AC=20
ticular question, it is not least to settle accounts with that hy=C2=AC=20
pocritical rabble which, counting on the forgetfulness and stu=C2=AC=20
pidity of our broad strata, has the insolence to mimic on this=20
point a national indignation, which is more alien especially to the=20
parliamentary swindlers than honest conceptions of property to=20
a magpie.=20

I would like to emphasize that I personally am among the men=20
who, when the fate of the South Tyrol was being decided =E2=80=94 that=20
is, beginning in August, 1914, up to November, 1918 =E2=80=94 went=20
where this territory was being actively defended =E2=80=94 I mean the=20
army. In those years I did my part of the fighting, not in order=20
that the South Tyrol should be lost, but in order that it should be=20
preserved for the fatherland just like every other German=20
province.=20


The South Tyrol Question=20


627=20


The ones who did not do their bit at that time were the parlia=C2=AC=20
mentary sneak-thieves, all the politics-playing party rabble.=20
On the contrary, while we fought in the conviction that only a=20
victorious issue to the War would preserve this South Tyrol for=20
the German nationality, the big-mouths of these Ephialteses=20
agitated and plotted against victory until at last the battling=20
Siegfried succumbed to the treacherous dagger thrust. For the=20
preservation of the South Tyrol in German possession was naturally=20
not guaranteed by the lying inflammatory speeches of parliamentary=20
sharpers on the Vienna Rathausplatz or in front of the Munich=20
Feldherrnhalle, but only by the battalions at the fighting front .=20
Those who broke this front betrayed the South Tyrol, just as they be=C2=AC=
=20
trayed all other German territories.=20

And anyone who believes today that he can solve the South=20
Tyrol question by protests, declarations, clubby parades , is either=20
a very special scoundrel or a German petit bourgeois.=20

We must clearly recognize the fact that the recovery of the lost ter=C2=AC=
=20

pious hopes in a League of Nations, but only by force of arms .=20

And so the only question is, Who is ready to attempt the recon=C2=AC=20
quest of these lost territories by defiant armed force?=20

As far as my person is concerned, I can here assure you with a=20
clear conscience that I could still muster up enough courage to=20
take part in the victorious conquest of the South Tyrol at the=20
head of a parliamentary storm battalion that ought to be formed,=20
consisting of parliamentary big-mouths and other party leaders=20
plus various privy councilors. God knows it would give me pleas=C2=AC=20

a =E2=80=98flaming=E2=80=99 protest demonstration. I think if a fox were to=

rush of the feathered fowl for safety any quicker, than the flight=20
of such a splendid =E2=80=98 protest rally/=20

But the vile thing about the whole business is that the gentle=C2=AC=20
men themselves do not believe they can achieve anything in this=20
way. They personally know, better than anyone else, the im=C2=AC=20
possibility and innocuousness of all the fuss they are making.=20


628=20

But they carry on as they do, because it is naturally somewhat=20

does his own part; then we sacrificed our blood, and today this=20

It is especially delightful, moreover, to see how Viennese legit=C2=AC=20

erous perjury to make it possible for the victorious world coalition=20
to win among other things the South Tyrol. At that time these=20
circles supported the policy of their treacherous dynasty, and=20
didn=E2=80=99t care a damn about the South Tyrol or anything else.=20
Today, of course, it is easier to take up the struggle for these=20
territories, for today, after all, it is fought only with =E2=80=98spiritua=

The reason why in the last few years certain definite circles have=20
made the =E2=80=98South Tyrol=E2=80=99 question the pivotal point of German=
-=20
Italian relations is obvious. Jews and Habsburg legitimists have=20
the greatest interest in preventing a German alliance policy which=20
might lead some day to the resurrection of a free German fatherland.=20
All this fuss today is not made for love of the South Tyrol =E2=80=94 which=
=20
it does not help but only harms =E2=80=94 but for fear of a possible German=

Italian understanding.=20

It is quite in keeping with the general hypocrisy and slanderous=20
tendencies of these circles when they attempt with cold and brazen=20
gall to make things look as if we had ( betrayed } the South Tyrol.=20

To these gentlemen let it be said with all plainness: the South=20
Tyrol was =E2=80=98 betrayed =E2=80=99 first and foremost by every German w=
ith sound=20
limbs who in the years 1914-1918 did not stand somewhere at the=20
front , putting his services at the disposal of the fatherland;=20

secondly , by every man who in those years did not help to strengthen=20

and=20
to fortify the endurance of our people for carrying through this fight=20
to the end;=20

thirdly, the South Tyrol was betrayed by every man who cooperated=20
in the outbreak of the November revolution =E2=80=94 whether directly by=20
deed or indirectly by the cowardly toleration of the deed =E2=80=94 and the=
reby=20
smashed the weapon which alone could have saved the South Tyrol,=20

Yes, my brave lip-service protesters, that is how things standi=20

Today I am guided only by the sober realization that lost territories=20
are not won back by sharp parliamentary big-mouths and their glib=C2=AC=20
ness of tongue, but by a sharp sword; in other words, by a bloody=20
fight.=20

But I do not hesitate to declare that, now the dice have fallen, I=20
not only regard a reconquest of the South Tyrol by war as impossible,=20
but that I personally would reject it in the conviction that for this=20
question the flame of national enthusiasm of the whole German people=20
could not be achieved to a degree which would offer the premise for=20
victory. I believe, on the contrary, that, if this blood some day were=20
staked, it would be a crime to stake it for two hundred thousand Ger=C2=AC=
=20
mans while next door more than seven millions languish under=20
foreign domination and the vital artery of the German people runs=20
through the hunting ground of African Negro hordes.=20

If the German nation wants to end a state of affairs that threatens=20
its extermination in Europe, it must not fall into the error of the pre-=20
War period and make enemies of God and the world; it must recog=C2=AC=20
nize the most dangerous enemy and strike at him with all its concen=C2=AC=

trated power. And if this victory is obtained through sacrifices else=C2=AC=

The more brilliant the resultant successes, the better they will appre=C2=
=AC=20
ciate the dire distress and profound cares, and the bitter decision born=20
of them.=20

What must guide us today is again and again the basic insight=20
that the reconquest of a Reich=E2=80=99s lost territories is primarily the=
=20
question of regaining the political independence and power of=20
the motherland.=20

To make this possible and sure by an astute alliance policy is=20

Here I must briefly take up those objections which apply to=20
the three questions raised above, to wit, the questions whether=20
anyone will=20

first, make an alliance with the present-day Germany in her visible=20
weakness that is clear for all to see;=20

secondly, whether the enemy nations seem capable of such a re=C2=AC=20
orientation; and=20

thirdly, whether the existing influence of the Jews is not stronger=20
than any understanding or good intentions and will thus frustrate=20
and nullify all plans.=20

I think I have sufficiently discussed one half of the first ques=C2=AC=20
tion. Of course, no one will make an alliance with present-day=20
Germany. No power in the world will venture to link its destiny=20
to a state whose government is bound to destroy all confidence.=20
And as regards the attempt of many of our national comrades to=20
condone the government=E2=80=99s actions because of the wretched men=C2=AC=
=20
tality of our people at the time, and even accept this as an excuse,=20
we must take the sharpest position against this.=20

1 Although the Niebelungenlied, the German national epic, is a tale of=20
treachery and deceit from beginning to end, in the German popular con=C2=AC=

First Signs of a German Rebirth=20


631=20


It is true, the absence of character in our people for the last=20
six years has been profoundly sad, their indifference toward the=20
most important concerns of our nation has been truly crushing,=20
their cowardice has sometimes cried out to high Heaven. But=20
it must not be forgotten that we are nevertheless dealing with a=20
people which a few years previous offered the world the most ad=C2=AC=20
mirable example of the highest human virtues. From the August=20
days of 1914 up to the end of the mighty conflict of nations, no=20
people on earth revealed more manly courage, tenacious en=C2=AC=20
durance, and patience in suffering than our German people which=20
has today grown so wretched. No one will maintain that the dis=C2=AC=20
grace of our present period is the characteristic expression of our=20
nation=E2=80=99s being. What we are compelled to experience around us=20
and in us today is only the horrible, maddening, and infuriating=20
influence of the perjuring deed of November 9, 1918. Here more=20
than ever the poet=E2=80=99s saying applies that evil begets evil. But even=
=20
at the present time, our people has not entirely lost its good basic=20
elements; they only are slumbering unawakened in the depths;=20
and from time to time it has been possible to see, gleaming like=20
summer lightning in an overcast firmament, virtues which the=20
future Germany will some day remember as the first signs of an=20
incipient recovery. More than once, thousands and thousands of=20
young Germans have stepped forward with the self-sacrificing=20
resolve to sacrifice their young lives freely and joyfully on the al=C2=AC=
=20
tar of the beloved fatherland, just as in 1914. Again, millions of=20
men are diligently and industriously at work, as though the=20
ravages of the revolution had never been. The blacksmith stands=20
again at his anvil, the peasant guides his plow, and the scholar=20
sits in his study, all with the same painstaking devotion to duty.=20

The repressions on the part of our enemies no longer meet the=20
same condoning laughter as formerly, but grieved, embittered=20
faces. Undoubtedly a great change in sentiment has taken place.=20

If today all this is not yet expressed in a rebirth of our people=E2=80=99s=
=20
concept of political power and instinct of self-preservation, it is=20
the fault of those who, less by the grace of Heaven than by self-=20
appointment, have governed our people to death since 1918.=20


632=20


Mein Kampf=20


Yes, if we bemoan the state of the nation today, we may ask:=20
What has been done to improve it? Is the feeble support given by=20
the people to the decisions of our governments =E2=80=94 decisions which=20
scarcely existed =E2=80=94 only a sign of our nation=E2=80=99s small vitali=
ty or=20
is it not even more a sign of total failure in the handling of this=20
precious treasure? What have our governments done to reimplant=20
the spirit of proud self-reliance , manly defiance , and wrathful=20
hatred in this people?=20

When in the year 1919 the German people was burdened with=20
the peace treaty, we should have been justified in hoping that=20
precisely through this instrument of boundless repression the cry=20
for German freedom would have been immensely promoted.=20
Peace treaties whose demands are a scourge to nations not seldom=20
strike the first roll of drums for the uprising to come.=20

What could have been done with this peace treaty of Ver=C2=AC=20
sailles? !=20

This instrument of boundless extortion and abject humiliation=20
might, in the hands of a willing government, have become an in=C2=AC=20
strument for whipping up the national passions to fever heat.=20
With a brilliant propagandist exploitation of these sadistic cruel=C2=AC=20
ties, the indifference of a people might have been raised to indig=C2=AC=20
nation, and indignation to blazing fury!=20

How could every single one of these points have been burned=20
into the brain and emotion of this people, until finally in sixty=20
million heads, in men and women, a common sense of shame and=20
a common hatred would have become a single fiery sea of flame,=20
from whose heat a will as hard as steel would have risen and a=20
cry burst forth:=20

Give us arms again!=20

Yes, my friends, that is what such a peace treaty would do. In=20
the boundlessness of its oppression, the shamelessness of its de=C2=AC=20
mands, lies the greatest propaganda weapon for the reawakening=20
of a nation=E2=80=99s dormant spirits of life.=20

For this, to be sure, from the child=E2=80=99s primer down to the last=20
newspaper, every theater and every movie house, every ad=C2=AC=20
vertising pillar and every billboard, must be pressed into the ser-=20


Transformation of Anti-German Psychosis 633=20

vice of this one great mission, until the timorous prayer of our=20
present parlor patriots: 'Lord, make us freer is transformed in=20
the brain of the smallest boy into the burning plea: 1 Almighty=20
God , bless our arms when the time comes; be just as thou hast always=20
been; judge now whether we be deserving of freedom; Lord , bless our=20
battle! =E2=80=99=20

All this was neglected and nothing was done.=20

Who, then, will be surprised that our people is not as it should=20
be and could be? If the rest of the world sees in us only a stooge,=20
an obsequious dog, who gratefully licks the hands that have just=20
beaten him?=20

Certainly our capacity for alliances today is injured by our=20
people, but most of all by its governments. They in their cor=C2=AC=20
ruption are to blame if after eight years of the most unlimited=20
oppression so little will for freedom is present.=20

Much, therefore, as an active alliance policy is linked with the=20
necessary evaluation of our people, the latter is equally dependent=20
on the existence of a governmental power which does not want to=20
be a handyman for foreign countries, not a taskmaster over its=20
own strength, but a herald of the national conscience.=20

If our people has a state leadership which sees its mission in=20
this light, six years will not pass before a bold Reich leadership=20
in the field of foreign affairs will dispose of an equally bold will=20
on the part of a people thirsting for freedom.=20

# # #=20

The second objection, the great difficulty of transforming hos=C2=AC=20
tile peoples into friendly allies, can be answered as follows:=20

The general anti-German psychosis cultivated in other countries=20
by war propaganda will inevitably continue to exist until the German=20
Reich , through the resurrection visible to all of a German will for self-=
=20
preservation, achieves the character of a state which plays on the gen=C2=
=AC=20
eral European chessboard and with which it is possible to play . Only=20
when government and people seem to provide absolute guaranty=20
of a possible fitness for alliance can one or another power, out of=20


634=20


Mein Kampf=20


parallel interest, think of reshaping public opinion by the effects=20
of propaganda. This, too, naturally requires years of shrewd=20
continuous work. The very need of this long period for altering=20
the sentiments of a people necessitates caution in undertaking it;=20
that is, no one will enter upon such an activity unless he is ab=C2=AC=20
solutely- convinced of the value of such a labor and its fruits for=20
the future. No one will want to change the spiritual orientation=20
of a nation on the strength of the empty bragging of some more=20
or less witty foreign minister, without possessing a tangible=20
guaranty of the value of a new orientation. Otherwise this would=20
lead to a complete shattering of public opinion. The most reliable=20
certainty for the possibility of a future alliance with a state does=20
not lie in the bombastic phrases of individual members of the gov=C2=AC=20
ernment, but in the visible stability of a definite and seemingly=20
expedient governmental tendency, and in a public opinion with=20
an analogous orientation. The faith in this will be the firmer, the=20
greater the visible activity of a governing power in the field of=20
propagandist preparation and foundation of its work, and, con=C2=AC=20
versely, the more unmistakably the will of public opinion is re=C2=AC=20
flected in the governmental tendency.=20

A nation , then , will =E2=80=94 in our situation =E2=80=94 he regarded as =
fit for=20
alliance , if government and public opinion with equal fanaticism=20
proclaim and uphold the will to fight for freedom. This is the pre=C2=AC=20
mise for beginning a reorientation in the public opinion of other=20
nations, which on the basis of their knowledge are willing, in=20
defense of their very own interests, to go a stretch of the way by=20
the side of a partner who seems suitable to them =E2=80=94 in other words,=
=20
to conclude an alliance.=20

But there is one thing more to be said in this connection: Since=20
the transformation of a certain spiritual attitude in a people requires=20
hard work in itself , and at first will not he understood by many , it is=
=20
a crime and a stupidity at once , to furnish these opposing elements=20
with weapons for their counter-efforts by mistakes of one=E2=80=99s own.=20

It must be realized that it will necessarily take a certain time=20
before a people has completely comprehended the inner purposes=20
of a government, since explanations cannot be given regarding the=20


Concentration on One Enemy=20


635=20


final ultimate aims of certain preliminary political work, and one=20
can only reckon either with the blind faith of the masses or the=20
intuitive insight of the intellectually superior leader strata. But=20
since in many people this clairvoyant political sixth sense is not=20
present, and for political reasons explanations cannot be given, a=20
part of the intellectual leader class will always turn against new=20
tendencies which due to their incomprehensibility can easily be=20
interpreted as mere experiments. Thus, the resistance of the=20
anxious conservative elements is aroused.=20

For this reason more than any other, it becomes our highest=20
duty to make sure that all serviceable weapons are wrested from=20
the hands of such disturbers of mutual understanding, especially=20
when, as in our case, we are dealing with nothing but the totally=20
impracticable, purely fantastic babble of inflated parlor patriots=20
and petit bourgeois cafe politicians. For on calm reflection no=20
one will seriously deny that screaming for a new battle fleet, for=20
recovery of our colonies, etc., is in reality nothing but silly gossip,=20
without so much as a thought of practical application. The way=20
in which the senseless outpourings of these knights of the protest=20
meeting, some of them innocent, some o=C2=A3 them insane, but all of=20
them in the silent service of our mortal enemies, are exploited=20
in England, cannot be characterized as favorable to Germany.=20
And so we wear ourselves out in harmful little demonstrations=20
against God and the whole world and forget the first principle=20
which is the premise for every success, to wit: Whatever you do ,=20
do it completely. By beefing against five or ten states , we neglect the=20
concentration of all our will power and physical force for the thrust to=20
the heart of our infamous enemy , and sacrifice the possibility of=20
strengthening ourselves by an alliance for this conflict.=20

Here , too , lies a mission for the National Socialist movement. It=20
must teach our people to look beyond trifles and see the biggest=20
things , not to split up over irrelevant things , and never to forget that=
=20
the aim for which we must fight today is the bare existence of our peo=C2=
=AC=20
ple , and the sole enemy which we must strike is and remains the power=20
which is robbing us of this existence.=20

Some things may be profoundly painful to us. But this is far from=20


6 36=20


Mein Kampf=20


being a ground for renouncing reason and bickering loudly and=20
senselessly with the whole world instead of attacking the most mortal=20
enemy in concentrated force.=20

Furthermore, the German people has no moral right to blame the=20
rest of the world for its conduct as long as it has not called to account=
=20
the criminals who sold and betrayed their whole country. Really,=20
it is not serious for us to curse and protest against England, Italy,=20
etc., from a distance, and leave the scoundrels at large who, in the=20
pay of enemy war propaganda, took away our arms, broke our moral=20
backbone, and auctioned ojf the crippled Reich for thirty pieces of=20
silver.=20

The enemy does only what was to be predicted. We should learn=20
from his conduct and his acts.=20

Anyone who is really unwilling to rise to the heights of such a=20
conception should finally bear in mind that the only thing re=C2=AC=20
maining in that case is renunciation, because then any alliance=20
policy is impossible for the future. For if we cannot ally ourselves=20
with England because she stole our colonies, or with Italy because=20
she has the South Tyrol, with Poland and Czechoslovakia on=20
their merits, then, aside from France =E2=80=94 who incidentally did=20
steal Alsace-Lorraine from us =E2=80=94 there would remain no one else=20
in Europe.=20

Whether this serves the German people is scarcely subject to=20
doubt. The only thing that can remain in doubt is whether such=20
an opinion is put forward by a simple dunce or by a shrewd ad=C2=AC=20
versary.=20

When it comes to leaders, I always believe the latter.=20

And so, in all human probability, a transformation of the psy=C2=AC=20
che of individual peoples, who have hitherto been hostile but=20
whose true future interests lie close to our own, may very well be=20
possible if the inner strength of our state as well as our visible will=20
for the preservation of our existence again make us seem worthy=20
as an ally, and, further, if awkward movements of our own, or=20
even criminal acts, do not furnish grist for the mill of the enemies=20
of such a future tie with nations previously hostile to us.=20

t# *=20


Fascist Italy and the Jews=20


637=20


The hardest to answer is the third objection.=20

Is it conceivable that the representatives of the real interests=20
of the nations possible for alliance can put through their views in=20
opposition to the will of the Jewish mortal enemy of free national=20
states?=20

Can the forces of traditional British statesmanship, for exam=C2=AC=20
ple, break the devastating Jewish influence or not?=20

This question, as already stated, is very hard to answer. It=20
depends on too many factors to permit of a conclusive judgment.=20
One thing is certain in any case: In one country the present state=20
power can he regarded as so stabilized and serves the interests of the=20
country so absolutely that we can no longer speak of a really effective=20
obstruction of political necessities by international Jewish forces.=20

The struggle that Fascist Italy is waging, though perhaps in=20
the last analysis unconsciously {which I personally do not believe ),=20
against the three main weapons of the Jews is the best indication=20
that, even though indirectly , the poison fangs of this supra-state=20
power are being torn out. The prohibition of Masonic secret so=C2=AC=20
cieties, the persecution of the supra-national press, as well as the=20
continuous demolition of international Marxism, and, conversely,=20
the steady reinforcement of the Fascist state conception, will in the=20
course of the years cause the Italian government to serve the interests=20
of the Italian people more and more, without regard for the hissing=20
of the Jewish world hydra.=20

Things are more difficult in England. In this country of the=20
=E2=80=98 freest democracy/ the Jew exerts an almost unlimited dictator=C2=
=AC=20
ship indirectly through public opinion. And yet, even there an=20
incessant struggle is taking place between the advocates of Brit=C2=AC=20
ish state interests and the proponents of a Jewish world dictator=C2=AC=20
ship.=20

How sharply these opposites often clash could be seen most=20
clearly for the first time after the War in the different attitude=20
toward the Japanese problem of the British government leaders=20
on the one hand and of the press on the other.=20

Immediately after the end of the War, the old strain in the rela=C2=AC=20
tions of America and Japan began to reappear. Of course, the=20


638=20


Mein Kampf=20


great European powers could not remain indifferent to this new=20
war danger. No ties of kinship can prevent a certain feeling of=20
envious concern in England toward the growth of the American=20
Union in all fields of international economic and power politics.=20
The former colonial country, child of the great mother, seems to=20
be growing into a new master of the world. It is understandable=20
that England today re-examines her old alliances with anxious=20
concern and British statesmen gaze with trepidation toward a=20
period in which it will no longer be said:=20

1 Britannia rules the waves I 9 But instead: ( The seas for the=20

It is harder to attack the gigantic American colossus of states=20
with the enormous wealth of its virgin soil than the wedged-in=20
German Reich. If the dice and the ultimate decision should ever=20
roll, 1 England, if left to her own resources would be doomed.=20
And so they snatch eagerly at the yellow fist and cling to an al=C2=AC=20
liance which, from the racial viewpoint, is perhaps unjustifiable,=20
but from the viewpoint of state politics nevertheless represents=20
the sole possibility of strengthening the British world position=20
in the face of the upsurging American continent.=20

While the English state leadership, despite the common strug=C2=AC=20
gle on the European battlefields, could not resolve to relax its al=C2=AC=
=20
liance with the Asiatic partner, the whole Jewish press fell on this=20
alliance from behind.=20

How is it possible that the organs of a Northcliffe, 2 until 1918=20
the faithful armor-bearer of the British struggle against the Ger=C2=AC=20
man Reich, should now break their loyalty and go their own ways?=20

The annihilation of Germany was not an English interest, but=20
primarily a Jewish one, just as today a destruction of Japan serves=20
British state interests less than it does the widespread desires of=20
the leaders of the projected Jewish world empire. While England=20
sweats to maintain her position in this world, the Jew organizes=20

Already the greatest heads of Jewry see the approaching fulfill=C2=AC=20
ment of their testamentary prophecy about the great devouring=20
of nations.=20

Within this great herd of denationalized colonial territories, a=20
single independent state might still wreck the whole work at the=20
eleventh hour. For a Bolshevistic world can exist only if it em=C2=AC=20
braces everything.=20

If only a single state is preserved in its national strength and=20
greatness, the world empire of Jewish satrapies, like every=20
tyranny in this world, must succumb to the force of the national=20
idea.=20

Now the Jew knows only too well that in his thousand years of=20
adaptation he may have been able to undermine European peo=C2=AC=20

scarcely be in a position to subject an Asiatic national state like=20
Japan to this fate. Today he may mimic the German and the=20
Englishman, the American and Frenchman, but he lacks the=20
bridges to the yellow Asiatic. And so he strives to break the=20
Japanese national state with the strength of similar existing for=C2=AC=20

the last state power is transformed in his hand into a despotism=20

And so he incites the nations against Japan as he once did=20
against Germany, and this is what brings it about that, while=20
British statesmen are still striving to build on the alliance with=20
Japan, the British-Jewish press already demands struggle against=20
the ally, and prepares the war of annihilation under the procla=C2=AC=20

That is how insubordinate the Jew has become in England to=C2=AC=20
day.=20

And for This reason it is there that the struggle against the=20
Jewish world menace will begin.=20

And again the National Socialist movement has the mightiest=20
task to fulfill.=20

It must open the eyes of the people on the subject of foreign nations=20
and must remind them again and again of the true enemy of our pres-=20
ent-day world. In place of hatred against Aryans, from whom al=C2=AC=20
most everything may separate us, but with whom we are bound by=20
common blood or the great line of a kindred culture, it must call eter=C2=

originator of our sufferings.=20

It must make certain that in our country, at least, the mortal=20
enemy is recognized and that the fight against him becomes a gleam=C2=AC=20

For the rest, may reason be our guide, may our will be our strength.=20

T=20

JL here are two reasons which induce me to=20
submit to a special examination the relation of Germany to=20
Russia:=20

1. Here perhaps we are dealing with the most decisive concern=20
of all German foreign affairs; and=20

2. This question is also the touchstone for the political capac=C2=AC=20
ity of the young National Socialist movements to think clearly=20
and to act correctly.=20

I must admit that the second point in particular sometimes fills=20
me with anxious concern. Since our young movement does not=20
obtain membership material from the camp of the indifferent,=20
but chiefly from very extreme outlooks, it is only too natural if=20
these people, in the field of understanding foreign affairs as in=20
other fields, are burdened with the preconceived ideas or feeble=20
understanding of the circles to which they previously belonged,=20
both politically and philosophically. And this by no means ap=C2=AC=20
plies only to the man who comes to us from the Left. On the con=C2=AC=20
trary. Harmful as his previous instruction with regard to such=20
problems might be, in part at least it was not infrequently bal=C2=AC=20
anced by an existing remnant of natural and healthy instinct.=20
Then it was only necessary to substitute a better attitude for the=20
influence that was previously forced upon him, and often the es=C2=AC=20
sentially healthy instinct and impulse of self-preservation that=20
still survived in him could be regarded as our best ally.=20


=E2=9C=93=20


642=20


Mein Kampf=20


It is much harder, on the other hand, to induce clear political=20
thinking in a man whose previous education in this field was no=20
less devoid of any reason and logic, but on top of all this had also=20
sacrified his last remnant of natural instinct on the altar of ob=C2=AC=20
jectivity. Precisely the members of our so-called intelligentsia=20
are the hardest to move to a really clear and logical defense of=20
their interests and the interests of their nation. They are not=20
only burdened with a dead weight of the most senseless concep=C2=AC=20
tions and prejudices, but what makes matters completely in=C2=AC=20
tolerable is that they have lost and abandoned all healthy in=C2=AC=20
stinct of self-preservation. The National Socialist movement is=20
compelled to endure hard struggles with these people, hard be=C2=AC=20
cause, despite total incompetence, they often unfortunately are=20
afilicted with an amazing conceit, which causes them to look down=20
without the slightest inner justification upon other people, for=20
the most part healthier than they. Supercilious, arrogant know-=20
it-alls, without any capacity for cool testing and weighing, which,=20
in turn, must be recognized as the pre-condition for any will and=20
action in the field of foreign affairs.=20

Since these very circles are beginning today to divert the ten=C2=AC=20
dency of our foreign policy in the most catastrophic way from any=20
real defense of the folkish interests of our people, placing it in=C2=AC=20
stead in the service of their fantastic ideology, I feel it incumbent=20
upon me to discuss for my supporters the most important ques=C2=AC=20
tion in the field of foreign affairs, our relation to Russia, in par=C2=AC=
=20
ticular, and as thoroughly as is necessary for the general under=C2=AC=20
standing and possible in the scope of such a work.=20

But first I would like to make the following introductory re=C2=AC=20
marks:=20

If under foreign policy we must understand the regulation of=20
a nation=E2=80=99s relations with the rest of the world, the manner of this=
=20
regulation will be determined by certain definite facts. As Na=C2=AC=20
tional Socialists we can, furthermore, establish the following=20
principle concerning the nature of the foreign policy of a folkish=20
state:=20

The foreign policy of the folkish state must safeguard the exist -=20


Significance of the State=E2=80=99s Area=20


643=20


ence on this planet of the race embodied in the state , by creating a=20
healthy , viable natural relation between the nation=E2=80=99s population a=
nd=20
growth on the one hand and the quantity and quality of its soil on=20
the other hand.=20

As a healthy relation we may regard only that condition which=20
assures the sustenance of a people on its own soil. Every other=20
condition, even if it endures for hundreds, nay, thousands of=20
years, is nevertheless unhealthy and will sooner or later lead to=20
the injury if not annihilation of the people in question.=20

Only an adequately large space on this earth assures a nation of=20
freedom of existence .=20

Moreover, the necessary size of the territory to be settled can=C2=AC=20
not be judged exclusively on the basis of present requirements,=20
not even in fact on the basis of the yield of the soil compared to=20
the population. For, as 1 explained in the first volume, under=20
=E2=80=98German Alliance Policy Before the War,=E2=80=99 in addition to its=
 im=C2=AC=20
portance as a direct source of a people=E2=80=99s food , another significan=
ce ,=20
that is, a military and political one , must be attributed to the area of=
=20
a state. If a nation=E2=80=99s sustenance as such is assured by the amount=
=20
of its soil, the safeguarding of the existing soil itself must also be=20
borne in mind. This lies in the general power-political strength=20
of the state, which in turn to no small extent is determined by geo=C2=AC=
=20
military considerations.=20

Hence, the German nation can defend its future only as a world=20
power. For more than two thousand years the defense of our=20
people=E2=80=99s interests, as we should designate our more or less for=C2=
=AC=20
tunate activity in the field of foreign affairs, was world history.=20
We ourselves were witnesses to this fact: for the gigantic struggle=20
of the nations in the years 1914-1918 was only the struggle of the=20
German people for its existence on the globe, but we designated=20
the type of event itself as a World War.=20

The German people entered this struggle as a supposed world=20
power. I say here =E2=80=98supposed,=E2=80=99 for in reality it was none. I=
f the=20
German nation in 1914 had had a different relation between area=20
and population, Germany would really have been a world power,=20
and the War, aside from all other factors, could have been ter=C2=AC=20
minated favorably.=20


644=20


Mein Kampe=20


Germany today is no world power. Even if our momentary mili=C2=AC=20
tary impotence were overcome, we should no longer have any=20
claim to this title. What can a formation, as miserable in its re=C2=AC=20
lation of population to area as the German Reich today, mean=20
on this planet? In an era when the earth is gradually being di=C2=AC=20
vided up among states, some of which embrace almost entire=20
continents, we cannot speak of a world power in connection with=20
a formation whose political mother country is limited to the ab=C2=AC=20
surd area of five hundred thousand square kilometers.=20

From the purely territorial point of view, the area of the Ger=C2=AC=20
man Reich vanishes completely as compared with that of the so-=20
called world powers. Let no one cite England as a proof to the=20
contrary, for England in reality is merely the great capital of the=20
British world empire which calls nearly a quarter of the earth=E2=80=99s=20
surface its own. In addition, we must regard as giant, states,=20
first of all the American Union, then Russia and China. All are=20
spatial formations having in part an area more than ten times=20
greater than the present German Reich. And even France must=20
be counted among these states. Not only that she complements=20
her army to an ever-increasing degree from her enormous empire=E2=80=99s=20
reservoir of colored humanity, but racially as well, she is making=20
such great progress in negrification that we can actually speak of=20
an African state arising on European soil. The colonial policy of=20
present-day France cannot be compared with that of Germany=20
in the past. If the development of France in the present style=20
were to be continued for three hundred years, the last remnants=20
of Frankish blood would be submerged in the developing Euro-=20
pean-African mulatto state. An immense self-contained area of=20
settlement from the Rhine to the Congo, filled with a lower race=20
gradually produced from continuous bastardization.=20

This distinguishes French colonial policy from the old German=20
one.=20

The former German colonial policy, like everything we did, was=20
carried out by halves. It neither increased the settlement area=20
of the German Reich, nor did it undertake any attempt =E2=80=94 crimi=C2=AC=
=20
nal though it would have been =E2=80=94 to strengthen the Reich by the=20


Historical Mission or National Socialism 645=20

use of black blood. The Askaris in German East Africa were a=20
short, hesitant step in this direction. Actually they served only=20
for the defense of the colonies themselves. The idea of bringing=20
black troops into a European battlefield, quite aside from its=20
practical impossibility in the World War, never existed even as a=20
design to be realized under more favorable circumstances, while,=20
on the contrary, it was always regarded and felt by the French=20
as the basic reason for their colonial activity.=20

Thus, in the world today we see a number of power states,=20
some of which not only far surpass the strength of our German=20
nation in population, but whose area above all is the chief sup=C2=AC=20
port of their political power. Never has the relation of the Ger=C2=AC=20
man Reich to other existing world states been as unfavorable as=20
at the beginning of our history two thousand years ago and=20
again today. Then we were a young people, rushing headlong=20
into a world of great crumbling state formations, whose last=20
giant, Rome, we ourselves helped to fell. Today we find ourselves=20
in a world of great power states in process of formation, with our=20
own Reich sinking more and more into insignificance.=20

We must bear this bitter truth coolly and soberly in mind. We=20
must follow and compare the German Reich through the centuries=20
in its relation to other states with regard to population and area.=20
I know that everyone will then come to the dismayed conclusion=20
which I have stated at the beginning of this discussion: Germany=20
is no longer a world power , regardless whether she is strong or weak=20
from the military point of view.=20

We have lost all proportion to the other great states of the=20
earth, and this thanks only to the positively catastrophic leader=C2=AC=20
ship of our nation in the field of foreign affairs, thanks to our total=20
failure to be guided by what I should almost call a testamentary=20
aim in foreign policy, and thanks to the loss of any healthy in=C2=AC=20
stinct and impulse of self-preservation.=20

If the National Socialist movement really wants to be consecrated=20
by history with a great mission for our nation , it must be permeated=20
by knowledge and filled with pain at our true situation in this world;=20
boldly and conscious of its goaf it must take up the struggle against=20


646=20


Mein Kampf=20


the aimlessness and incompetence which have hitherto guided our Ger=C2=AC=
=20
man nation in the line of foreign affairs. Then , without considera=C2=AC=
=20
tion of =E2=80=98traditions=E2=80=99 and prejudices , it must find the cour=
age to gather=20
our people and their strength for an advance along the road that will=20
lead this people from its present restricted living space to new land=20
and soil , and hence also free it from the danger of vanishing from=20
the earth or of serving others as a slave nation.=20

The National Socialist movement must strive to eliminate the dis=C2=AC=20
proportion between our population and our area =E2=80=94 viewing this lat=
=C2=AC=20
ter as a source of food as well as a basis for power politics =E2=80=94 be=
=C2=AC=20
tween our historical past and the hopelessness of our present im=C2=AC=20
potence. And in this it must remain aware that we, as guardians=20
of the highest humanity on this earth, are bound by the highest=20
obligation, and the more it strives to bring the German people to=20
racial awareness so that, in addition to breeding dogs, horses,=20
and cats, they will have mercy on their own blood, the more it=20
will be able to meet this obligation.=20


# # #=20


If I characterize German policy up to now as aimless and in=C2=AC=20
competent, the proof of my assertion lies in the actual failure of=20
this policy. If our people had been intellectually inferior or=20
cowardly, the results of its struggle on the earth could not be=20
worse than what we see before us today. Neither must the de=C2=AC=20
velopment of the last decades before the War deceive us on this=20
score; for we cannot measure the strength of an empire by itself,=20
but only by comparison with other states. And just such a com=C2=AC=20
parison furnishes proof that the increase in strength of the other=20
states was not only more even, but also greater in its ultimate ef=C2=AC=20
fect; that consequently, despite its apparent rise, Germany=E2=80=99s=20
road actually diverged more and more from that of the other=20
states and fell far behind; in short, the difference in magnitudes=20
increased to our disfavor. Yes, as time went on, we fell behind=20
more and more even in population. But since our people is cer-=20

tainly excelled by none on earth in heroism, in fact, all in all has=20
certainly given the most blood of all the nations on earth for the=20
preservation of its existence, the failure can reside only in the=20
mistaken way in which it was given.=20

If we examine the political experiences of our people for more=20
than a thousand years in this connection, passing all the in=C2=AC=20
numerable wars and struggles in review and examining the pres=C2=AC=20
ent end result they created, we shall be forced to admit that this=20
sea of blood has given rise to only three phenomena which we are=20
justified in claiming as enduring fruits of clearly defined actions=20
in the field of foreign and general politics:=20

(1) The colonization of the Ostmark, carried out mostly by=20
Bavarians;=20

(2) the acquisition and penetration of the territory east of the=20
Elbe; and=20

(3) the organization by the Hohenzollerns of the Brandenburg-=20
Prussian state as a model and nucleus for crystallization of a new=20
Reich.=20

An instructive warning for the future!=20

The first two great successes of our foreign policy have re=C2=AC=20
mained the most enduring. Without them our nation today would=20
no longer have any importance at all. They were the first, but=20
unfortunately the only successful attempt to bring the rising=20
population into harmony with the quantity of our soil. And it=20
must be regarded as truly catastrophic that our German histo=C2=AC=20
rians have never been able to estimate correctly these two achieve=C2=AC=20
ments which are by far the greatest and most significant for the=20
future, but by contrast have glorified everything conceivable,=20
praised and admired fantastic heroism, innumerable adventurous=20
wars and struggles, instead of finally recognizing how unimportant=20
most of these events have been for the nation=E2=80=99s great line of=20
development.=20

The third great success of our political activity lies in the for=C2=AC=20
mation of the Prussian state and the resultant cultivation of a=20
special state idea, as also of the German army=E2=80=99s instinct of self-=
=20
preservation and self-defense, adapted to the modern world and=20


648=20


Mein Kampf=20


put into organized form. The development of the idea of in=C2=AC=20
dividual militancy into the duty of national militancy [con=C2=AC=20
scription] has grown out of every state formation and every state=20
conception. The significance of this development cannot be over=C2=AC=20
estimated. Through the discipline of the Prussian army organ=C2=AC=20
ism, the German people, shot through with ^yperindividualism=20
by their racial divisions, won back at least a part of the capacity=20
for organization which they had long since lost. What other peo=C2=AC=20
ples still primitively possess in their herd community instinct, we,=20
partially at least, regained artificially for our national community=20
through the process of military training. Hence the elimination=20
of universal conscription =E2=80=94 which for dozens of other peoples=20
might be a matter of no importance =E2=80=94 is for us fraught with the=20
gravest consequences. Ten German generations without correc=C2=AC=20
tive and educational military training, left to the evil effects of=20
their racial and hence philosophical division =E2=80=94 and our nation=20
would really have lost the last remnant of an independent exist=C2=AC=20
ence on this planet. Only through individual men, in the bosom of=20
foreign nations, could the German spirit make its contribution to=20
culture, and its origin would not even be recognized. Cultural=20
fertilizer, until the last remnant of Aryan-Nordic blood in us=20
would be corrupted or extinguished.=20

It is noteworthy that the significance of these real political=20
successes won by our nation in its struggles, enduring more than=20
a thousand years, were far better understood and appreciated=20
by our adversaries than by ourselves. Even today we still rave=20
about a heroism which robbed our people of millions of its noblest=20
blood-bearers, but in its ultimate result remained totally fruitless.=20

The distinction between the real political successes of our peo=C2=AC=20
ple and the national blood spent for fruitless aims is of the greatest=20
importance for our conduct in the present and the future.=20

We National Socialists must never under any circumstances join=20
in the foul 1 hurrah patriotism of our present bourgeois world . In=20
particular it is mortally dangerous to regard the last pre-War de-=20

Clamor for the Old Frontiers=20


649=20


velopments as binding even in the slightest degree for our own course.=20
From the whole historical development of the nineteenth cen=C2=AC=20
tury, not a single obligation can be derived which was grounded=20
in this period itself. In contrast to the conduct of the representa=C2=AC=
=20
tives of this period, we must again profess the highest aim of=20
all foreign policy, to wit: to bring the soil into harmony with the=20
population. Yes, from the past we can only learn that, in setting=20
an objective for our political activity, we must proceed in two=20
directions: Land and soil as the goal of our foreign policy , and a=20
new philosophically established , uniform foundation as the aim of=20
political activity at home.=20


# # =C2=BB=20

I still wish briefly to take a position on the question as to what=20
extent the demand for soil and territory seems ethically and mor=C2=AC=20
ally justified. This is necessary, since unfortunately, even in so-=20
called folkish circles, all sorts of unctuous big-mouths step for=C2=AC=20
ward, endeavoring to set the rectification of the injustice of 1918=20
as the aim of the German nation=E2=80=99s endeavors in the field of foreign=
=20
affairs, but at the same time find it necessary to assure the whole=20
world of folkish brotherhood and sympathy.=20

I should like to make the following preliminary remarks: The=20
demand for restoration of the frontiers of 1911+ is a political absurdity=
=20
of such proportions and consequences as to make it seem a crime .=20
Quite aside from the fact that the Reich's frontiers in 1914 were any=C2=AC=
=20
thing but logical. For in reality they were neither complete in the=20
sense of embracing the people of German nationality , nor sensible=20
with regard to geo-military expediency. They were not the result of a=20
considered political action , but momentary frontiers in a political=20
struggle that was by no means concluded; partly , in fact , they were=20
the results of chance. With equal right and in many cases with=20
more right, some other sample year of German history could be=20
picked out, and the restoration of the conditions at that time=20
declared to be the aim of an activity in foreign affairs. The above=20


650=20


Mein Kampf=20


demand is entirely suited to our bourgeois society, which here as=20
elsewhere does not possess a single creative political idea for the=20
future, but lives only in the past, in fact, in the most immediate=20
past; for even their backward gaze does not extend beyond their=20
own times. The law of inertia binds them to a given situation=20
and causes them to resist any change in it, but without ever in=C2=AC=20
creasing the activity of this opposition beyond the mere power of=20
perseverance. So it is obvious that the political horizon of these=20
people does not extend beyond the year 1914. By proclaiming the=20
restoration of those borders as the political aim of their activity,=20
they keep mending the crumbling league of our adversaries.=20
Only in this way can it be explained that eight years after a world=20
struggle in which states, some of which had the most heterogene=C2=AC=20
ous desires, took part, the coalition of the victors of those days=20
can still maintain itself in a more or less unbroken form.=20

All these states were at one time beneficiaries of the German=20
collapse. Fear of our strength caused the greed and envy of the=20
individual great powers among themselves to recede. By grab=C2=AC=20
bing as much of the Reich as they could, they found the best=20
guard against a future uprising. A bad conscience and fear of our=20
people=E2=80=99s strength is still the most enduring cement to hold to=C2=
=AC=20
gether the various members of this alliance.=20

And we do not disappoint them. By setting up the restoration=20
of the borders of 1914 as a political program for Germany, our=20
bourgeoisie frighten away every partner who might desire to leave=20
the league of our enemies, since he must inevitably fear to be at=C2=AC=20
tacked singly and thereby lose the protection of his individual=20
fellow allies. Each single state feels concerned and threatened by=20
this slogan.=20

Moreover, it is senseless in two respects:=20

(1) because the instruments of power are lacking to remove it=20
from the vapors of club evenings into reality; and=20

(2) because, if it could actually be realized, the outcome would=20
again be so pitiful that, by God, it would not be worth while to=20
risk the blood of our people for this.=20

For it should scarcely seem questionable to anyone that evei?=20


National Socialist Aim in Foreign Policy 651=20


the restoration of the frontiers of 1914 could be achieved only by=20
blood. Only childish and naive minds can lull themselves in the=20
idea that they can bring about a correction of Versailles by wheed=C2=AC=20
ling and begging. Quite aside from the fact that such an attempt=20
would presuppose a man of Talleyrand=E2=80=99s talents, which we do not=20
possess. One half of our political figures consist of extremely=20
sly, but equally spineless elements which are hostile toward our=20
nation to begin with, while the other is composed of good-=20
natured, harmless, and easy-going soft-heads. Moreover, the=20
times have changed since the Congress of Vienna: Today it is not=20
princes and princes=E2=80=99 mistresses who haggle and bargain over state=
=20
borders; it is the inexorable Jew who struggles for his domination=20
over the nations. No nation can remove this hand from its throat=20
except by the sword. Only the assembled and concentrated might=20
of a national passion rearing up in its strength can defy the inter=C2=AC=
=20
national enslavement of peoples. Such a process is and remains=20
a bloody one.=20

If, however, we harbor the conviction that the German future,=20
regardless what happens, demands the supreme sacrifice, quite=20
aside from all considerations of political expediency as such, we=20
must set up an aim worthy of this sacrifice and fight for it.=20

The boundaries of the year 1914 mean nothing at all for the=20
German future. Neither did they provide a defense of the past,=20
nor would they contain any strength for the future. Through=20
them the German nation will neither achieve its inner integrity,=20
nor will its sustenance be safeguarded by them, nor do these=20
boundaries, viewed from the military standpoint, seem expedient=20
or even satisfactory, nor finally can they improve the relation in=20
which we at present find ourselves toward the other world powers,=20
or, better expressed, the real world powers. The lag behind Eng=C2=AC=20
land will not be caught up, the magnitude of the Union will not=20
be achieved; not even France would experience a material diminu=C2=AC=20
tion of her world-political importance.=20

Only one thing would be certain: even with a favorable out=C2=AC=20
come, such an attempt to restore the borders of 1914 would lead=20
to a further bleeding of our national body, so much so that there=20


652=20


Mein Kampf=20


would be no worth-while blood left to stake for the decisions and=20
actions really to secure the nation=E2=80=99s future. On the contrary,=20
drunk with such a shallow success, we should renounce any fur=C2=AC=20
ther goals, all the more readily as =E2=80=98national honor=E2=80=99 would =
be re=C2=AC=20
paired and, for the moment at least, a few doors would have been=20
reopened to commercial development.=20

As opposed to this, we National Socialists must hold unflinch=C2=AC=20
ingly to our aim in foreign policy, namely, to secure for the German=20
people the land and soil to which they are entitled on this earth.=20
And this action is the only one which, before God and our Ger=C2=AC=20
man posterity, would make any sacrifice of blood seem justified:=20
before God, since we have been put on this earth with the mission=20
of eternal struggle for our daily bread, beings who receive nothing=20
as a gift, and who owe their position as lords of the earth only to=20
the genius and the courage with which they can conquer and de=C2=AC=20
fend it; and before our German posterity in so far as we have shed=20
no citizen=E2=80=99s blood out of which a thousand others are not be=C2=AC=
=20
queathed to posterity. The soil on which some day German=20
generations of peasants can beget powerful sons will sanction the=20
investment of the sons of today, and will some day acquit the=20
responsible statesmen of blood-guilt and sacrifice of the people,=20
even if they are persecuted by their contemporaries.=20

And I must sharply attack those folkish pen-pushers who claim=20
to regard such an acquisition of soil as a =E2=80=98breach of sacred human=
=20
rights=E2=80=99 and attack it as such in their scribblings. One never=20
knows who stands behind these fellows. But one thing is certain,=20
that the confusion they can create is desirable and convenient=20
to our national enemies. By such an attitude they help to=20
weaken and destroy from within our people=E2=80=99s will for the only=20
correct way of defending their vital needs. For no people on=20
this earth possesses so much as a square yard of territory on the=20
strength of a higher will or superior right. Just as Germany=E2=80=99s=20
frontiers are fortuitous frontiers, momentary frontiers in the cur=C2=AC=20
rent political struggle of any period, so are the boundaries of=20
other nations=E2=80=99 living space. And just as the shape of our earth=E2=
=80=99s=20
surface can seem immutable as granite only to the thoughtless=20


No Sentimentality in Foreign Policy=20


653=20


soft-head, but in reality only represents at each period an ap=C2=AC=20
parent pause in a continuous development, created by the mighty=20
forces of Nature in a process of continuous growth, only to be=20
transformed or destroyed tomorrow by greater forces, likewise=20
the boundaries of living spaces in the life of nations.=20

State boundaries are made by man and changed by man.=20

The fact that a nation has succeeded in acquiring an undue=20
amount of soil constitutes no higher obligation that it should be=20
recognized eternally. At most it proves the strength of the con=C2=AC=20
querors and the weakness of the nations. And in this case, right=20
lies in this strength alone. If the German nation today, penned=20
into an impossible area, faces a lamentable future, this is no more=20
a commandment of Fate than revolt against this state of affairs=20
constitutes an affront to Fate. No more than any higher power=20
has promised another nation more territory than the German na=C2=AC=20
tion, or is offended by the fact of this unjust distribution of the=20
soil. Just as our ancestors did not receive the soil on which we=20
live today as a gift from Heaven, but had to fight for it at the=20
risk of their lives, in the future no folkish grace will win soil=20
for us and hence life for our people, but only the might of a vic=C2=AC=20
torious sword.=20

Much as all of us today recognize the necessity of a reckoning=20
with France, it would remain ineffectual in the long run if it repre=C2=AC=
=20
sented the whole of our aim in foreign policy. It can and will=20
achieve meaning only if it offers the rear cover for an enlarge=C2=AC=20
ment of our people=E2=80=99s living space in Europe. For it is not in=20
colonial acquisitions that we must see the solution of this problem,=20
but exclusively in the acquisition of a territory for settlement,=20
which will enhance the area of the mother country, and hence=20
not only keep the new settlers in the most intimate community=20
with the land of their origin, but secure for the total area those=20
advantages which lie in its unified magnitude.=20

The folkish movement must not be the champion of other=20
peoples, but the vanguard fighter of its own. Otherwise it is=20
superfluous and above all has no right to sulk about the past.=20
For in that case it is behaving in exactly the same way. The old=20


654=20


Mein Kampf=20


German policy was wrongly determined by dynastic considera=C2=AC=20
tions, and the future policy must not be directed by cosmopoli=C2=AC=20
tan folkish drivel. In particular, we are not constables guarding=20
the well-known =E2=80=98poor little nations/ but soldiers of our own na=C2=
=AC=20
tion.=20

But we National Socialists must go further. The right to possess=20
soil can become a duty if without extension of its soil a great nation=20
seems doomed to destruction. And most especially when not some=20
little nigger nation or other is involved, but the Germanic mother=20
of life, which has given the present-day world its cultural picture.=20
Germany will either be a world power or there will be no Germany.=20
And for world power she needs that magnitude which will give=20
her the position she needs in the present period, and life to her=20
citizens.=20


*TV*=20

And so we National Socialists consciously draw a line beneath the=20
foreign policy tendency of our pre-War period. We take up where=20
we broke off six hundred years ago. We stop the endless German=20
movement to the south and west , and turn our gaze toward the land=20
in the east. At long last we break off the colonial and commercial=20
policy of the pre-War period and shift to the soil policy of the future.=20

If we speak of soil in Europe today, we can primarily have in=20
mind only Russia and her vassal border states.=20

Here Fate itself seems desirous of giving us a sign. By handing=20
Russia to Bolshevism, it robbed the Russian nation of that intel=C2=AC=20
ligentsia which previously brought about and guaranteed its=20
existence as a state. For the organization of a Russian state for=C2=AC=20
mation was not the result of the political abilities of the Slavs in=20
Russia, but only a wonderful example of the state-forming effi-=20
cacity of the German element in an inferior race. Numerous=20
mighty empires on earth have been created in this way. Lower=20
nations led by Germanic organizers and overlords have more than=20
once grown to be mighty state formations and have endured as=20


Resumption of Eastern Policy=20


655=20


long as the racial nucleus of the creative state race maintained it=C2=AC=
=20
self. For centuries Russia drew nourishment from this Germanic=20
nucleus of its upper leading strata. Today it can be regarded as=20
almost totally exterminated and extinguished. It has been re=C2=AC=20
placed by the Jew. Impossible as it is for the Russian by himself=20
to shake off the yoke of the Jew by his own resources, it is equally=20
impossible for the Jew to maintain the mighty empire forever.=20
He himself is no element of organization, but a ferment of de=C2=AC=20
composition. The Persian 1 empire in the east is ripe for collapse.=20
And the end of Jewish rule in Russia will also be the end of Rus=C2=AC=20
sia as a state. We have been chosen by Fate as witnesses of a=20
catastrophe which will be the mightiest confirmation of the sound=C2=AC=20
ness of the foikish theory.=20

Our task , the mission of the National Socialist movement , is to=20
bring our own people to such political insight that they will not see=20
their goal for the future in the breath-taking sensation of a new=20
Alexander=E2=80=99s conquest , but in the industrious work of the German=20
plow , to which the sword need only give soil.=20

4k 4k 4k=20

It goes without saying that the Jews announce the sharpest re=C2=AC=20
sistance to such a policy. Better than anyone else they sense the=20
significance of this action for their own future. This very fact=20
should teach all really national-minded men the correctness of=20
such a reorientation. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case.=20
Not only in German-National, but even in =E2=80=98folkislT circles, the=20
idea of such an eastern policy is violently attacked, and, as al=C2=AC=20
most always in such matters, they appeal to a higher authority.=20
The spirit of Bismarck is cited to cover a policy which is as sense=C2=AC=
=20
less as it is impossible and in the highest degree harmful to the=20
German nation. Bismarck in his time, they say, always set store=20
on good relations with Russia. This, to a certain extent, is true.=20
But they forget to mention that he set just as great store on good=20

1 Second edition has =E2=80=98giant=E2=80=99 instead of =E2=80=98Persian.=
=E2=80=99=20


656=20


Mein Kampf=20


relations with Italy, for example; in fact, that the same Herr von=20
Bismarck once made an alliance with Italy in order to finish off=20
Austria the more easily. Why, then, don=E2=80=99t they continue this=20
policy? * Because the Italy of today is not the Italy of those=20
days,=E2=80=99 they will say. Very well. But then, honored sirs, will you=
=20
permit the objection that present-day Russia is not the Russia=20
of those days either? It never entered Bismarck=E2=80=99s head to lay=20
down a political course tactically and theoretically for all time.=20
In this respect he was too much master of the moment to tie his=20
hands in such a way. The question, therefore, must not he: What=20
did Bismarck do in his time? But rather: What would he do today?=20
And this question is easier to answer. With his political astute=C2=AC=20
ness, he would never ally himself with a stale that is doomed to=20
destruction .=20

Furthermore, Bismarck even then viewed the German colonial=20
and commercial policy with mixed feelings, since for the moment=20
he was concerned only with the surest method of internally con=C2=AC=20
solidating the state formation he had created. And this was the=20
only reason why at that time he welcomed the Russian rear cover,=20
which gave him a free hand in the west. But what was profitable=20
to Germany then would be detrimental today.=20

As early as 1920-21, when the young National Socialist move=C2=AC=20
ment began slowly to rise above the political horizon, and here=20
and there was referred to as the movement for German freedom,=20
the party was approached by various quarters with an attempt to=20
create a certain bond between it and the movements for freedom=20
in other countries . This was in the line of the 1 League of Oppressed=20
Nations, =E2=80=99 propagated by many. Chiefly involved were representa=C2=
=AC=20
tives of various Balkan states, and some from Egypt and India,=20
who as individuals always impressed me as pompous big-mouths=20
without any realistic background. But there were not a few Ger=C2=AC=20
mans, especially in the nationalist camp, who let themselves be=20
dazzled .by such inflated Orientals and readily accepted any old=20
Indian or Egyptian student from God knows where as a 1 repre=C2=AC=20
sentative=E2=80=99 of India or Egypt. These people never realized that=20
they were usually dealing with persons who had absolutely=20




The =E2=80=98League of Oppressed Nations=E2=80=99=20


657=20


nothing behind them, and above all were authorized by no one=20
to conclude any pact with anyone, so that the practical result of=20
any relations with such elements was nil, unless the time wasted=20
were booked as a special loss. I always resisted such attempts.=20
Not only that I had better things to do than twiddle away weeks=20
in fruitless =E2=80=98conferences,=E2=80=99 but even if these men had been =
author=C2=AC=20
ized representatives of such nations, I regarded the whole business=20
as useless, in fact, harmful.=20

Even in peacetime it was bad enough that the German alliance=20
policy, for want of any aggressive intentions of our own, ended in=20
a defensive union of ancient states, pensioned by world history.=20
The alliance with Austria as well as Turkey had little to be said=20
for them. While the greatest military and industrial states on=20
earth banded into an active aggressive union, we collected a few=20
antique, impotent state formations and with this decaying rub=C2=AC=20
bish attempted to face an active world coalition. Germany re=C2=AC=20
ceived a bitter accounting for this error in foreign policy. But this=20
accounting does not seem to have been bitter enough to prevent=20
our eternal dreamers from falling headlong into the same error.=20
For the attempt to disarm the almighty victors through a=20
=E2=80=98League of Oppressed Nations' is not only ridiculous, but cata=C2=
=AC=20
strophic as well. It is catastrophic because it distracts our people=20
again and again from the practical possibilities, making them de=C2=AC=20
vote themselves to imaginative, yet fruitless hopes and illusions.=20
The German of today really resembles the drowning man who=20
grasps at every straw. And this can apply even to men who are=20
otherwise exceedingly well educated. If any will-o=E2=80=99-the-wisp of=20
hope, however unreal, turns up anywhere, these men are off at a=20
trot, chasing after the phantom. Whether it is a League of Op=C2=AC=20
pressed Nations, a League of Nations, or any other fantastic new=20
invention, it will be sure to find thousands of credulous souls.=20

I still remember the hopes, as childish as they were incompre=C2=AC=20
hensible, which suddenly arose in folkish circles in 1920-21, to the=20
effect that British power was on the verge of collapse in India.=20
Some Asiatic jugglers, for all I care they may have been real=20
=E2=80=98fighters for Indian freedom,=E2=80=99 who at that time were wander=
ing=20


658=20


Mein Kampf=20


around Europe, had managed to sell otherwise perfectly reason=C2=AC=20
able people the idee fixe that the British Empire, which has its=20
pivot in India, was on the verge of collapse at that very point.=20
Of course, it never entered their heads that here again their own=20
wish was the sole father of all their thoughts. No more did the=20
inconsistency of their own hopes. For by expecting the end of the=20
British Empire to follow from a collapse of British rule in India,=20
they themselves admitted that India was of the most paramount=20
importance to England.=20

It is most likely, however, that this vitally important question=20
is not a profound secret known only to German-folkish prophets;=20
presumably it is known also to the helmsmen of English destiny.=20
It is really childish to suppose that the men in England cannot=20
correctly estimate the importance of the Indian Empire for the=20
British world union. And if anyone imagines that England would=20
let India go without staking her last drop of blood, it is only a=20
sorry sign of absolute failure to learn from the World War, and of=20
total misapprehension and ignorance on the score of Anglo-=20
Saxon determination. It is, furthermore, a proof of the German=E2=80=99s=20
total ignorance regarding the whole method of British penetra=C2=AC=20
tion and administration of this empire. England will lose India=20
either if her own administrative machinery falls a prey to racial=20
decomposition (which at the moment is completely out of the ques=C2=AC=20
tion in India) or if she is bested by the sword of a powerful enemy.=20
Indian agitators, however, will never achieve this. How hard it=20
is to best England, we Germans have sufficiently learned. Quite=20
aside from the fact that I, as a man of Germanic blood, would, in=20
spite of everything, rather see India under English rule than under=20
any other.=20

Just as lamentable are the hopes in any mythical uprising in=20
Egypt. The =E2=80=98 Holy War=E2=80=99 can give our German Schafkopf player=
s=20
the pleasant thrill of thinking that now perhaps others are ready=20
to shed their blood for us =E2=80=94 for this cowardly speculation, to tell=
=20
the truth, has always been the silent father of all hopes; in reality=20
it would come to an infernal end under the fire of English machine-=20
gun companies and the hail of fragmentation bombs.=20


German Alliance with Russia?=20


659=20


It just happens to be impossible to overwhelm with a coalition=20
of cripples a powerful state that is determined to stake, if neces=C2=AC=20
sary, its last drop of blood for its existence. As a folkish man, who=20
appraises the value of men on a racial basis, I am prevented by=20
mere knowledge of the racial inferiority of these so-called =E2=80=98op=C2=
=AC=20
pressed nations=E2=80=99 from linking the destiny of my own people with=20
theirs.=20

And today we must take exactly the same position toward=20
Russia. Present-day Russia, divested of her Germanic upper=20
stratum, is, quite aside from the private intentions of her new=20
masters, no ally for the German nation=E2=80=99s fight for freedom. Con=C2=
=AC=20
sidered from the purely military angle, the relations would be simply=20
catastrophic in case of war between Germany and Russia and West=C2=AC=20
ern Europe, and probably against all the rest of the world. The=20
struggle would take place, not on Russian, but on German soil, and=20
Germany would not be able to obtain the least effective support=20
from Russia. The present German Reich=E2=80=99s instruments of power=20
are so lamentable and so useless for a foreign war, that no de=C2=AC=20
fense of our borders against Western Europe, including England,=20
would be practicable, and particularly the German industrial=20
region would lie defenselessly exposed to the concentrated aggres=C2=AC=20
sive arms of our foes. There is the additional fact that between=20
Germany and Russia there lies the Polish state, completely in=20
French hands. In case of a war between Germany and Russia=20
and Western Europe, Russia would first have to subdue Poland=20
before the first soldier could be sent to the western front. Yet it=20
is not so much a question of soldiers as of technical armament.=20
In this respect, the World War situation would repeat itself, only=20
much more horribly. Just as German industry was then drained=20
for our glorious allies, and, technically speaking, Germany had to=20
fight the war almost single-handed, likewise in this struggle Rus=C2=AC=20
sia would be entirely out of the picture as a technical factor. We=20
could oppose practically nothing to the general motorization of=20
the world, which in the next war will manifest itself overwhelm=C2=AC=20
ingly and decisively. For not only that Germany herself has re=C2=AC=20
mained shamefully backward in this all-important field, but from=20


660=20


Mein Kampf=20


the little she possesses she would have to sustain Russia, which=20
even today cannot claim possession of a single factory capable of=20
producing a motor vehicle that really runs. Thus, such a war=20
would assume the character of a plain massacre. Germany=E2=80=99s=20
youth would be bled even more than the last time, for as always=20
the burden of the fighting would rest only upon us, and the result=20
would be inevitable defeat.=20

But even supposing that a miracle should occur and that such=20
a struggle did not end with the total annihilation of Germany,=20
the ultimate outcome would only be that the German nation,=20
bled white, would remain as before bounded by great military=20
states and that her real situation would hence have changed in=20
no way.=20

Let no one argue that in concluding an alliance with Russia we=20
need not immediately think of war, or, if we did, that we could=20
thoroughly prepare for it. An alliance whose aim does not embrace=20
a plan for war is senseless and worthless . Alliances are concluded=20
only for struggle. And even if the clash should be never so far=20
away at the moment when the pact is concluded, the prospect of=20
a military involvement is nevertheless its cause. And do not=20
imagine that any power would ever interpret the meaning of such=20
an alliance in any other way. Either a German-Russian coalition=20
would remain on paper, or from the letter of the treaty it would be=20
translated into visible reality =E2=80=94 and the rest of the world would=
=20
be warned. How naive to suppose that in such a case England=20
and France would wait a decade for the German-Russian alliance=20
to complete its technical preparations. No, the storm would break=20
over Germany with the speed of lightning.=20

And so the very fact of the conclusion of an alliance with Russia=20
embodies a plan for the next war. Its outcome would be the end of=20
Germany.=20

On top of this there is the following:=20

1. The present rulers of Russia have no idea of honorably entering=20
into an alliance , let alone observing one .=20

Never forget that the rulers of present-day Russia are common=20
blood-stained criminals; that they are the scum of humanity=20


German Alliance with Russia?=20


661=20


which, favored by circumstances, overran a great state in a tragic=20
hour, slaughtered and wiped out thousands of her leading intel=C2=AC=20
ligentsia in wild blood lust, and now for almost ten years have=20
been carrying on the most cruel and tyrannical regime of all time.=20
Furthermore, do not forget that these rulers belong to a race which=20
combines, in a rare mixture, bestial cruelty and an inconceivable=20
gift for lying, and which today more than ever is conscious of a=20
mission to impose its bloody oppression on the whole world. Do=20
not forget that the international Jew who completely dominates=20
Russia today regards Germany, not as an ally, but as a state=20
destined to the same fate. And you do not make pacts with anyone=20
whose sole interest is the destruction of his partner. Above all, you=20
do not make them with elements to whom no pact would be=20
sacred, since they do not live in this world as representatives of=20
honor and sincerity, but as champions of deceit, lies, theft, plun=C2=AC=20
der, and rapine. If a man believes that he can enter into profitable=20
connections with parasites, he is like a tree trying to conclude for=20
its own profit an agreement with a mistletoe.=20

2. The danger to which Russia succumbed is always present for=20
Germany. Only a bourgeois simpleton is capable of imagining that=20
Bolshevism has been exorcised. With his superficial thinking he=20
has no idea that this is an instinctive process; that is, the striving=20
of the Jewish people for world domination, a process which is just=20
as natural as the urge of the Anglo-Saxon to seize domination of=20
the earth. And just as the Anglo-Saxon pursues this course in=20
his own way and carries on the fight with his own weapons, like=C2=AC=20
wise the Jew. He goes his way, the way of sneaking in among the=20
nations and boring from within, and he fights with his weapons,=20
with lies and slander, poison and corruption, intensifying the=20
struggle to the point of bloodily exterminating his hated foes.=20
In Russian Bolshevism we must see the attempt undertaken by the=20
Jews in the twentieth century to achieve world domination. Just as=20
in other epochs they strove to reach the same goal by other,=20
though inwardly related processes. Their endeavor lies pro=C2=AC=20
foundly rooted in their essential nature. No more than another=20
nation renounces of its own accord the pursuit of its impulse for=20

Mein Kampf=20


the expansion of its power and way of life, but is compelled by=20
outward circumstances or else succumbs to impotence due to the=20
symptoms of old age, does the Jew break off his road to world=20
dictatorship out of voluntary renunciation, or because he re=C2=AC=20
presses his eternal urge. He, too, will either be thrown back in=20
his course by forces lying outside himself, or all his striving for=20
world domination will be ended by his own dying out. But the=20
impotence of nations, their own death from old age, arises from=20
the abandonment of their blood purity. And this is a thing that=20
the Jew preserves better than any other people on earth. And=20
so he advances on his fatal road until another force comes forth=20
to oppose him, and in a mighty struggle hurls the heaven-stormer=20
back to Lucifer.=20

Germany is today the next great war aim of Bolshevism. It=20
requires all the force of a young missionary idea to raise our peo=C2=AC=20
ple up again, to free them from the snares of this international=20
serpent, and to stop the inner contamination of our blood, in=20
order that the forces of the nation thus set free can be thrown in=20
to safeguard our nationality, and thus can prevent a repetition=20
of the recent catastrophes down to the most distant future. If=20
we pursue this aim, it is sheer lunacy to ally ourselves with a=20
power whose master is the mortal enemy of our future. How can=20
we expect to free our own people from the fetters of this poisonous=20
embrace if we walk right into it? How shall we explain Bolshe=C2=AC=20
vism to the German worker as an accursed crime against human=C2=AC=20
ity if we ally ourselves with the organizations of this spawn of hell,=20
thus recognizing it in the larger sense? By what right shall we=20
condemn a member of the broad masses for his sympathy with an=20
outlook if the very leaders of the state choose the representatives=20
of this outlook for allies?=20

The fight against Jewish world Bolshevization requires a clear=20
attitude toward Soviet Russia . You cannot drive out the Devil with=20
Beelzebub.=20

If today even folkish circles rave about an alliance with Russia,=20
they should just look around them in Germany and see whose=20
support they find in their efforts. Or have folkish .men lately be-=20

gun to view an activity as beneficial to the German people which=20
is recommended and promoted by the international Marxist=20
press? Since when do folkish men fight with armor held out to=20
them by a Jewish squire?=20

There is one main charge that could be raised against the old Ger=C2=AC=20
man Reich with regard to its alliance policy: not , however , that it=20
failed to maintain good relations with Russia , but only that it ruined=20
its relations with everyone by continuous shilly-shallying , in the=20
pathological weakness of trying to preserve world peace at any price .=20

I openly confess that even in the pre-War period I would have=20
thought it sounder if Germany, renouncing her senseless colonial=20
policy and renouncing her merchant marine and war fleet, had=20
concluded an alliance with England against Russia, thus passing=20
from a feeble global policy to a determined European policy of=20
territorial acquisition on the continent.=20

I have not forgotten the insolent threat which the pan-Slavic=20
Russia of that time dared to address to Germany; I have not for=C2=AC=20
gotten the constant practice mobilizations, whose sole purpose=20
was an affront to Germany; I cannot forget the mood of public=20
opinion in Russia, which outdid itself in hateful outbursts against=20
our people and our Reich; I cannot forget the big Russian news=C2=AC=20
papers, which were always more enthusiastic about France than=20
about us.=20

But in spite of all that, before the War there would still have=20
been a second way: we could have propped ourselves on Russia=20
and turned against England.=20

Today conditions are different. If before the War we could have=20
choked down every possible sentiment and gone with Russia, to=C2=AC=20
day it is no longer possible. The hand of the world clock has=20
moved forward since then, and is loudly striking the hour in=20
which the destiny of our nation must be decided in one way or=20
another. The process of consolidation in which the great states=20
of the earth are involved at the moment is for us the last warning=20
signal to stop and search our hearts, to lead our people out of the=20
dream world back to hard reality, and show them the way to the=20
future which alone will lead the old Reich to a new golden age.=20

If the National Socialist movement frees itself from all illusions=20
with regard to this great and all-important task, and accepts=20
reason as its sole guide, the catastrophe of 1918 can some day be=C2=AC=20
come an infinite blessing for the future of our nation. Out of this=20
collapse our nation will arrive at a complete reorientation of its=20
activity in foreign relations, and, furthermore, reinforced within=20
by its new philosophy of life, will also achieve outwardly a final=20
stabilization of its foreign policy. Then at last it will acquire what=20
England possesses and even Russia possessed, and what again and=20

# # #=20

I should not like to conclude these reflections without pointing=20
once again to the sole alliance possibility which exists for us at the=20
moment in Europe. In the previous chapter on the alliance=20
problem I have already designated England and Italy as the only=20
two states in Europe with which a closer relationship would be=20


Alliance with England and Italy=20


665=20


desirable and promising for us. Here I shall briefly touch on the=20
military importance of such an alliance.=20

The military consequences of concluding this alliance would in=20
every respect be the opposite of the consequences of an alliance=20
with Russia. The most important consideration, first of all, is=20
the fact that in itself an approach to England and Italy in no way=20
conjures up a war danger . France, the sole power which could con=C2=AC=20
ceivably oppose the alliance, would not be in a position to do so.=20
And consequently the alliance would give Germany the possibility=20
of peacefully making those preparations for a reckoning with France ,=20
which would have to be made in any event within the scope of such a=20
coalition . For the significant feature of such an alliance lies pre=C2=AC=
=20
cisely in the fact that upon its conclusion Germany would not sud=C2=AC=20
denly be exposed to a hostile invasion, but that the opposing al=C2=AC=20
liance would break of its own accord; the Entente, to which we=20
owe such infinite misfortune, would be dissolved, and hence=20
France , the mortal enemy of our nation , would be isolated. Even=20
if this success is limited at first to moral effect, it would suffice=20
to give Germany freedom of movement to an extent which today=20
is scarcely conceivable. For the law of action would be in the hands=20
of the new European Anglo-German-Italian alliance and no longer=20
with France.=20

The further result would be that at one stroke Germany would be=20
freed from her unfavorable strategic position. The most powerfm=20
protection on our flank on the one hand, complete guaranty of our=20
food and raw materials on the other, would be the beneficial ef=C2=AC=20
fect of the new constellation of states.=20

But almost more important would be the fact that the new league=20
would embrace states which in technical productivity almost comple=C2=AC=20
ment one another in many respects. For the first time Germany=20
would have allies who would not drain our own economy like=20
leeches, but could and would contribute their share to the richest=20
supplementation of our technical armament.=20

And do not overlook the final fact that in both cases we should=20
be dealing with allies who cannot be compared with Turkey or=20
present-day Russia. The greatest world power on earth and a youth-=20


666=20


Mein Kampf=20


ful national state would offer different premises for a struggle in=20
Europe than the putrid state corpses with which Germany allied her=C2=AC=20
self in the last war.=20

Assuredly, as I emphasized in the last chapter, the difficulties=20
opposing such an alliance are great. But was the formation of the=20
Entente, for instance, any less difficult? What the genius of=20
a King Edward VII achieved, in part almost counter to natural in=C2=AC=20
terests, we, too, must and will achieve, provided we are so inspired=20
by our awareness of the necessity of such a development that with=20
astute self-control we determine our actions accordingly. And this=20
will become possible in the moment when, imbued with admonish=C2=AC=20
ing distress, 1 we pursue, not the diplomatic aimlessness of the=20
last decades, but a conscious and determined course, and stick to=20
it. Neither western nor eastern orientation must be the future goal of=20
our foreign policy , but an eastern policy in the sense of acquiring the=20
necessary soil for our German people. Since for this we require=20
strength, and since France, the mortal enemy of our nation, in=C2=AC=20
exorably strangles us and robs us of our strength, we must take upon=20
ourselves eroery sacrifice whose consequences are calculated to contri=C2=
=AC=20
bute to the annihilation of French efforts toward hegemony in Europe.=20
Today every power is our natural ally, which like us feels French=20
domination on the continent to be intolerable. No path to such a=20
power can be too hard for us, and no renunciation can seem unut=C2=AC=20
terable if only the end result offers the possibility of downing our=20
grimmest enemy. Then, if we can cauterize and close the biggest=20
wound, we can calmly leave the cure of our slighter wounds to the=20
soothing effects of tine.=20

Today, of course, we are subjected to the hateful yapping of=20
the enemies of our people within. We National Socialists must=20
never let this divert us from proclaiming what in our innermost=20
conviction is absolutely necessary. Today, it is true, we must=20
brace ourselves against the current of a public opinion con=C2=AC=20
founded by Jewish guile exploiting German gullibility; sometimes,=20
it is true, the waves break harshly and angrily about us, but he=20
who swims with the stream is more easily overlooked than he who=20

11 erfiillt von der Mahnenden Not,=E2=80=99 a Wagnerism.=20


The Basis of Eastern Policy=20


667=20


bucks the waves. Today we are a reef; in a few years Fate may=20
raise us up as a dam against which the general stream will break,=20
and flow into a new bed.=20

It is, therefore, necessary that the National Socialist movement=20
be recognized and established in the eyes of all as the champion=20
of a definite political purpose. Whatever Heaven may have in store=20
for us, let men recognize us by our very visor!=20

Once we ourselves recognize the crying need which must de=C2=AC=20
termine our conduct in foreign affairs, from this knowledge will=20
flow the force of perseverance which we sometimes need when,=20
beneath the drumfire of our hostile press hounds, one or another=20
of us is seized with fear and there creeps upon him a faint desire=20
to grant a concession at least in some field, and howl with the=20
wolves, in order not to have everyone against him.=20


CHAPTER=20

XV=20


The Right of Emergency Defense=20


The armistice of November, 1918, ush-=20
ered in a policy which in all human probability was bound to lead=20
gradually to total submission. Historical examples of a similar=20
nature show that nations which lay down their arms without=20
compelling reasons prefer in the ensuing period to accept the=20
greatest humiliations and extortions rather than attempt to=20
change their fate by a renewed appeal to force.=20

This is humanly understandable. A shrewd victor will, if pos=C2=AC=20
sible, always present his demands to the vanquished in install=C2=AC=20
ments. And then, with a nation that has lost its character =E2=80=94 and=20
this is the case of every one which voluntarily submits =E2=80=94 he=20
can be sure that it will not regard one more of these individual=20
oppressions as an adequate reason for taking up arms again.=20
The more extortions are willingly accepted in this way, the more=20
unjustified it strikes people finally to take up the defensive=20
against a new, apparently isolated, though constantly recurring,=20
oppression, especially when, all in all, so much more and greater=20
misfortune has already been borne in patient silence.=20

The fall of Carthage is the most horrible picture of such a slow=20
execution of a people through its own deserts.=20

That is why Clausewitz in his Drei Bekenntnisse 1 incomparably=20
singles out this idea and nails it fast for all time, when he says:=20

1 Karl von Clausewitz (1780-1831), the eminent military strategist. His=20
chief work is Vom Krieg.=20


Nothing Accomplished by Submission=20


669=20


=E2=80=98That the stain of a cowardly submission can never be ef=C2=AC=20
faced; that this drop of poison in the blood of a people is passed=20
on to posterity and will paralyze and undermine the strength of=20
later generations =E2=80=99; that, on the other hand, =E2=80=98 even the lo=
ss of this=20
freedom after a bloody and honorable struggle assures the re=C2=AC=20
birth of a people and is the seed of life from which some day a new=20
tree will strike fast roots/=20

Of course, a people that has lost all honor and character will not=20
concern itself with such teachings. For no one who takes them to=20
heart can sink so low; only he who forgets them, or no longer=20
wants to know them, collapses. Therefore, we must not expect=20
those who embody a spineless submission suddenly to look into=20
their hearts and, on the basis of reason and all human experience,=20
begin to act differently than before. On the contrary, it is these=20
men in particular who will dismiss all such teachings until either=20
the nation is definitely accustomed to its yoke of slavery or until=20
better forces push to the surface, to wrest the power from the=20
hands of the infamous spoilers. In the first case these people=20
usually do not feel so badly, since not seldom they are appointed=20
by the shrewd victors to the office of slave overseer, which these=20
spineless natures usually wield more mercilessly over their people=20
than any foreign beast put in by the enemy himself.=20

The development since 1918 shows us that in Germany the hope=20
of winning the victor=E2=80=99s favor by voluntary submission unfor=C2=AC=
=20
tunately determines the political opinions and the actions of the=20
broad masses in the most catastrophic way. I attach special im=C2=AC=20
portance to emphasizing the broad masses, because I cannot bring=20
myself to profess the belief that the commissions and omissions=20
of our people=E2=80=99s leaders are attributable to the same ruinous lunacy=
.=20
As the leadership of our destinies has, since the end of the War,=20
been quite openly furnished by Jews, we really cannot assume=20
that faulty knowledge alone is the cause of our misfortune; we=20
must, on the contrary, hold the conviction that conscious purpose=20
is destroying our nation. And once we examine the apparent=20
madness of our nation=E2=80=99s leadership in the field of foreign affairs=
=20
from this standpoint, it is revealed as the subtlest, ice-cold logic,=20


670=20


Mein Kampf=20


in the service of the Jewish idea and struggle for world conquest.=20

And thus, it becomes understandable that the same time-span,=20
which from 1806 to 1813 sufficed to imbue a totally collapsed=20
Prussia with new vital energy and determination for struggle,=20
today has not only elapsed unused, but, on the contrary, has led=20
to an ever-greater weakening of our state.=20

Seven years after November, 1918, the Treaty of Locarno was=20
signed.=20

The course of events was that indicated above: Once the dis=C2=AC=20
graceful armistice had been signed, neither the energy nor the=20
courage could be summoned suddenly to oppose resistance to our=20
foes=E2=80=99 repressive measures, which subsequently were repeated=20
over and over. Our enemies were too shrewd to demand too=20
much at once. They always limit their extortions to the amount=20
which, in their opinion =E2=80=94 and that of the German leadership =E2=80=
=94=20
would at the moment be bearable enough so that an explosion oi=20
popular feeling need not be feared. But the more of these in=C2=AC=20
dividual dictates had been signed, the less justified it seemed, be=C2=AC=
=20
cause of a single additional extortion or exacted humiliation, to=20
do the thing that had not been done because of so many others:=20
to offer resistance. For this is the =E2=80=98 drop of poison =E2=80=99 of =
which Clause-=20
witz speaks: the spinelessness which once begun must increase=20
more and more and which gradually becomes the foulest heritage,=20
burdening every future decision. It can become a terrible lead=20
weight, a weight which a nation is not likely to shake off, but=20
which finally drags it down into the existence of a slave race.=20

Thus, in Germany edicts of disarmament alternated with edicts=20
of enslavement, political emasculation with economic pillage, and=20
finally created that moral spirit which can regard the Dawes=20
Plan as a stroke of good fortune and the Treaty of Locarno as a=20
success. Viewing all this from a higher vantage-point, we can=20
speak of one single piece of good fortune in all this misery, which=20
is that, though men can be befuddled, the heavens cannot be=20
bribed. For their blessing remained absent: since then hardship=20
and care have been the constant companions'of our people, and=20
our one faithful ally has been misery. Destiny made no exception=20


Persecution of Unwelcome Prophets=20


671=20


in this case, but gave us what we deserved. Since we no longer=20
know how to value honor, it teaches us at least to appreciate=20
freedom in the matter of bread. By now people have learned to=20
cry out for bread, but one of these days they will pray for freedom.=20

Bitter as was the collapse of our nation in the years after 1918,=20
and obvious at that very time, every man who dared prophesy=20
even then what later always materialized was violently and reso=C2=AC=20
lutely persecuted. Wretched and bad as the leaders of our nation=20
were, they were equally arrogant, and especially when it came to=20
ridding themselves of undesired, because unpleasant, prophets.=20
We were treated to-the spectacle (as we still are today!) of the=20
greatest parliamentary thick-heads, regular saddlers and glove-=20
makers =E2=80=94 and not only by profession, which in itself means=20
nothing =E2=80=94 suddenly setting themselves on the pedestal of states=C2=
=AC=20
men, from which they could lecture down at plain ordinary mor=C2=AC=20
tals. It had and has nothing to do with the case that such a=20
=E2=80=98statesman* by the sixth month of his activity is shown up as the=
=20
most incompetent windbag, the butt of everyone=E2=80=99s ridicule and=20
contempt, that he doesn=E2=80=99t know which way to turn and has pro=C2=AC=
=20
vided unmistakable proof of his total incapacity! No, that makes=20
no difference, on the contrary: the more lacking the parliamentary=20
statesmen of this Republic are in real accomplishment, the more=20
furiously they persecute those who expect accomplishments from=20
them, who have the audacity to point out the failure of their pre=C2=AC=20
vious activity and predict the failure of their future moves. But=20
if once you finally pin down one of these parliamentary honora-=20
bles, and this political showman really cannot deny the collapse=20
of his whole activity and its results any longer, they find thou=C2=AC=20
sands and thousands of grounds for excusing their lack of success,=20
and there is only one that they will not admit, namely, that they=20
themselves are the main cause of all evil.=20

By the winter of 1922-23, at the latest, it should have been=20


672=20


Mein Kampf=20


generally understood that even after the conclusion of peace=20
France was still endeavoring with iron logic to achieve the war=20
aim she had originally had in mind. For no one will be likely to=20
believe that France poured out the blood of her people =E2=80=94 never=20
too rich to begin with =E2=80=94 for four and a half years in the most de=
=C2=AC=20
cisive struggle of her history, only to have the damage previously=20
done made good by subsequent reparations. Even Alsace-Lor=C2=AC=20
raine in itself would not explain the energy with which the French=20
carried on the War, if it had not been a part of French foreign=20
policy=E2=80=99s really great political program for the future. And this=20
goal is: the dissolution of Germany into a hodge-podge of little=20
states. That is what chauvinistic France fought for, though at=20
the same time in reality it sold its people as mercenaries to the in=C2=AC=
=20
ternational world Jew.=20

This French war aim would have been attainable by the War=20
alone if, as Paris had first hoped, the struggle had taken place on=20
German soil. Suppose that the bloody battles of the World War=20
had been fought, not on the Somme, in Flanders, in Artois, before=20
Warsaw, Nijni-Novgorod, Kovno, Riga, and all the other places,=20
but in Germany, on the Ruhr and the Main, on the Elbe, at=20
Hanover, Leipzig, Nuremberg, etc., and you will have to agree=20
that this would have offered a possibility of breaking up Ger=C2=AC=20
many. It is very questionable whether our young federative=20
state could for four and a half years have survived the same test=20
of strain as rigidly centralized France, oriented solely toward her=20
uncontested center in Paris. The fact that this gigantic struggle=20
of nations occurred outside the borders of our fatherland was not=20
only to the immortal credit of the old army, it was also the great=C2=AC=20
est good fortune for the German future. It is my firm and heart=C2=AC=20
felt conviction, and sometimes almost a source of anguish to me,=20
that otherwise there would long since have been no German=20
Reich, but only =E2=80=98 German states.=E2=80=99 And this is the sole reas=
on why=20
the blood of our fallen friends and brothers has at least not=20
flowed entirely in vain.=20

Thus everything turned out differently! True, Germany col=C2=AC=20
lapsed like a flash in November, 1918. But when the catastrophe=20


Inexorable Political Aim of France=20


673=20


occurred in the homeland, our field armies were still deep in=20
enemy territory. The first concern of France at that time was=20
not the dissolution of Germany, but: How shall we get the Ger=C2=AC=20
man armies out of France and Belgium as quickly as possible?=20
And so the first task of the heads of state in Paris for concluding=20
the World War was to disarm the German armies and if possible=20
drive them back to Germany at once; and only after that could=20
they devote themselves to the fulfillment of their real and original=20
war aim. In this respect, to be sure, France was already para=C2=AC=20
lyzed. For England the War had really been victoriously con=C2=AC=20
cluded with the annihilation of Germany as a colonial and com=C2=AC=20
mercial power and her reduction to the rank of a second-class=20
state. Not only did the English possess no interest in the total=20
extermination of the German state; they even had every reason=20
to desire a rival against France in Europe for the future. Hence=20
the French political leaders had to continue with determined=20
peacetime labor what the War had begun, and Clemenceau=E2=80=99s=20
utterance, that for him the peace was only the continuation of=20
the War, took on an increased significance.=20

Persistently, on every conceivable occasion, they had to shatter=20
the structure of the Reich. By the imposition of one disarma=C2=AC=20
ment note after another, on the one hand, and by the economic=20
extortion thus made possible, on the other hand, Paris hoped=20
slowly to disjoint the Reich structure. The more rapidly national=20
honor withered away in Germany, the sooner could economic pres=C2=AC=20
sure and unending poverty lead to destructive political effects.=20
Such a policy of political repression and economic plunder, car=C2=AC=20
ried on for ten or twenty years, must gradually ruin even the best=20
state structure and under certain circumstances dissolve it..=20
And thereby the French war aim would finally be achieved.=20

By the winter of 1922-23 this must long since have been recog=C2=AC=20
nized as the French intent. Only two possibilities remained:=20
We might hope gradually to blunt the French will against the=20
tenacity of the German nation, or at long last to do what would=20
have to be done in the end anyway, to pull the helm of the Reich=20
ship about on some particularly crass occasion, and ram the=20


674=20


Mein Kampf=20


enemy. This, to be sure, meant a life-and-death struggle, and=20
there existed a prospect of life only if previously we succeeded in=20
isolating France to such a degree that this second war would not=20
again constitute a struggle of Germany against the world, but=20
a defense of Germany against a France which was constantly dis=C2=AC=20
turbing the world and its peace.=20

I emphasize the fact, and I am firmly convinced of it, that this=20
second eventuality must and will some day occur, whatever hap=C2=AC=20
pens. I never believe that France=E2=80=99s intentions toward us could=20
ever change, for in the last analysis they are merely in line with=20
the self-preservation of the French nation. If I were a French=C2=AC=20
man, and if the greatness of France were as dear to me as that of=20
Germany is sacred, I could not and would not act any differently=20
from Clemenceau. The French nation, slowly dying out, not only=20
with regard to population, but particularly with regard to its=20
best racial elements, can in the long run retain its position in the=20
world only if Germany is shattered. French policy may pursue=20
a thousand detours; somewhere in the end there will be this goal,=20
the fulfillment of ultimate desires and deepest longing. And it is=20
false to believe that a purely passive will, desiring only to pre=C2=AC=20
serve itself, can for any length of time resist a will that is no less=20
powerful, but proceeds actively. As long as the eternal conflict he -=20
tween Germany and France is carried on only in the form of a Ger=C2=AC=20
man defense against French aggression , it will never he decided , hut=20
from year to year f from century to century , Germany will lose one=20
position after another. Follow the movements of the German lan=C2=AC=20
guage frontier beginning with the twelfth century until today,=20
and you will hardly be able to count on the success of an attitude=20
and a development which has done us so much damage up till=20
now.=20

Only when this is fully understood in Germany, so that the=20
vital will of the German nation is no longer allowed to languish=20
in purely passive defense, but is pulled together for a final active=20
reckoning with France and thrown into a last decisive struggle=20
with the greatest ultimate aims on the German side =E2=80=94 only then=20
will we be able to end the eternal and essentially so fruitless,=20


Occupation of the Ruhr=20


675=20


struggle between ourselves and France; presupposing, of course,=20
that Germany actually regards the destruction of France as=20
only a means which will afterward enable her finally to give our=20
people the expansion made possible elsewhere. Today we count=20
eighty million Germans in Europe! This foreign policy will be=20
acknowledged as correct only if, after scarcely a hundred years,=20
there are two hundred and fifty million Germans on this con=C2=AC=20
tinent, and not living penned in as factory coolies for the rest of=20
the world, but: as peasants and workers, who guarantee each=20
other=E2=80=99s livelihood by their labor.=20

In December, 1922, the situation between Germany and France=20
again seemed menacingly exacerbated. France was contemplat=C2=AC=20
ing immense new extortions, and needed pledges for them.=20
The economic pillage had to be preceded by a political pressure=20
and it seemed to the French that only a violent blow at the nerve=20
center of our entire German life would enable them to subject=20
our =E2=80=98recalcitrant=E2=80=99 people to a sharper yoke. With the occup=
ation=20
of the Ruhr , the French hoped not only to break the moral back=C2=AC=20
bone of Germany once and for all, but to put us into an embar=C2=AC=20
rassing economic situation in which, whether we liked it or not,=20
we would have to assume every obligation, even the heaviest.=20

It was a question of bending and breaking. Germany bent at=20
the very outset, and ended up by breaking completely later.=20

With the occupation of the Ruhr, Fate once again held out a=20
hand to help the German people rise again. For what at the first=20
moment could not but seem a great misfortune embraced on=20
closer inspection an infinitely promising opportunity to terminate=20
all German misery.=20

From the standpoint of foreign relations, the occupation of the=20
Ruhr for the first time really alienated England basically from=20
France, and not only in the circles of British diplomacy which had=20
concluded, examined, and maintained the French alliance as=20
such only with the sober eye of cold calculators, but also in the=20
broadest circles of the English people. The English economy in=20
particular viewed with ill-concealed displeasure this new and in=C2=AC=20
credible strengthening of French continental power. For not=20


676=20


Mein Kampf=20


only that France, from the purely politico-military point of view,=20
now assumed a position in Europe such as previously not even=20
Germany had possessed, but, economically as well, she now ob=C2=AC=20
tained economic foundations which almost combined a position=20
of economic monopoly with her capacity for political competition.=20
The largest iron mines and coal fields in Europe were thus united=20
in the hands of a nation which, in sharp contrast to Germany,=20
had always defended its vital interests with equal determination=20
and activism, and which in the Great War had freshly reminded=20
the whole world of its military reliability. With the occupation=20
of the Ruhr coal fields by France, England=E2=80=99s entire gain through=20
the War was wrested from her hands, and the victor was no longer=20
British diplomacy so industrious and alert, but Marshal Foch and=20
the France he represented.=20

In Italy, too, the mood against France, which, since the end of=20
the War, had been by no means rosy to begin with, shifted to a=20
veritable hatred. It was the great, historical moment in which=20
the allies of former days could become the enemies of tomorrow.=20
If things turned out differently and the allies did not, as in the=20
second Balkan War, suddenly break into a sudden feud among=20
themselves, this was attributable only to the circumstance that=20
Germany simply had no Enver Pasha, but a Reich Chancellor=20
Cuno.=20

Yet not only from the standpoint of foreign policy, but of do=C2=AC=20
mestic policy as well, the French assault on the Ruhr held great=20
future potentialities for Germany. A considerable part of our=20
people which, thanks to the incessant influence of our lying press,=20
still regarded France as the champion of progress and liberalism,=20
was abruptly cured of this lunatic delusion. Just as the year 1914=20
had dispelled the dreams of international solidarity between peo=C2=AC=20
ples from the heads of our German workers and led them suddenly=20
back into the world of eternal struggle, throughout which one=20
being feeds on another and the death of the weaker means the=20
life of the stronger, the spring of 1923 did likewise.=20

When the Frenchman carried out his threats and finally,=20
though at first cautiously and hesitantly, began to move into the=20


Possibilities After Occupation of the Ruhr? 677=20

lower German coal district, a great decisive hour of destiny had=20
struck for Germany. If in this moment our people combined a=20
change of heart with a shift in their previous attitude, the Ruhr=20
could become a Napoleonic Moscow for France. There were=20
only two possibilities: Either we stood for this new offense and did=20
nothing , or, directing the eyes of the German people to this land of=20
glowing smelters and smoky furnaces, we inspired them with a glow=C2=AC=20
ing will to end this eternal disgrace and rather take upon themselves=20
the terrors of the ynoment than bear an endless terror one moment=20
longer.=20

To have discovered a third way was the immortal distinction=20
of Reich Chancellor Cuno, to have admired it and gone along,=20
the still more glorious distinction of our German bourgeois=20
parties.=20

Here I shall first examine the second course as briefly as pos=C2=AC=20
sible.=20

With the occupation of the Ruhr, France had accomplished a=20
conspicuous breach of the Versailles Treaty. In so doing, she had=20
also put herself in conflict with a number of signatory powers, and=20
especially with England and Italy. France could no longer hope=20
for any support on the part of these states for her own selfish=20
campaign of plunder; She herself, therefore, had to bring the ad=C2=AC=20
venture =E2=80=94 and that is what it was at first =E2=80=94 to some happy=
=20
conclusion. For a national German government there could be=20
but a single course, that which honor prescribed. It was certain=20
that for the present France could not be opposed by active force=20
of arms; but we had to realize clearly that any negotiations, unless=20
backed by power, would be absurd and fruitless. Without the=20
possibility of active resistance, it was absurd to adopt the stand=C2=AC=20
point: =E2=80=98 We shall enter into no negotiations=E2=80=99; but it was e=
ven more=20
senseless to end by entering into negotiations after all, without=20
having meanwhile equipped ourselves with power.=20

Not that we could have prevented the occupation of the Ruhr=20
by military measures. Only a madman could have advised such a=20
decision. But utilizing the impression made by this French action=20
and while it was being carried out, what we absolutely should=20


678=20


Mein Kampf=20


have done was, without regard for the Treaty of Versailles which=20
France herself had torn up, to secure the military resources with=20
which we could later have equipped our negotiators. For it was=20
clear from the start that one day the question of this territory=20
occupied by France would be settled at some conference table.=20
But we had to be equally clear on the fact that even the best=20
negotiators can achieve little success, as long as the ground on=20
which they stand and the chair on which they sit is not the shield=20
arm of their nation. A feeble little tailor cannot argue with ath=C2=AC=20
letes, and a defenseless negotiator has always suffered the sword=20
of Brennus on the opposing side of the scale, unless he had his=20
own to throw in as a counterweight. Or has it not been miserable=20
to watch the comic-opera negotiations which since 1918 have al=C2=AC=20
ways preceded the repeated dictates? This degrading spectacle=20
presented to the whole world, first inviting us to the conference=20
table, as though in mockery, then presenting us with decisions and=20
programs prepared long before, which, to be sure, could be dis=C2=AC=20
cussed, but which from the start could only be regarded as un=C2=AC=20
alterable. It is true that our negotiators, in hardly a single case,=20
rose above the most humble average, and for the most part=20
justified only too well the insolent utterance of Lloyd George, who=20
contemptuously remarked, a propos of former Reich Minister=20
Simon, * that the Germans didn=E2=80=99t know how to choose men of in=C2=AC=
=20
telligence as their leaders and representatives.=E2=80=99 But even gen=C2=
=AC=20
iuses, in view of the enemy=E2=80=99s determined will to power and the=20
miserable defenselessness of our own people in every respect,=20
would have achieved but little.=20

But anyone who in the spring of 1923 wanted to make France=E2=80=99s=20
occupation of the Ruhr an occasion for reviving our military im=C2=AC=20
plements of power had first to give the nation its spiritual weap=C2=AC=20
ons, strengthen its will power, and destroy the corrupters of this=20
most precious national strength.=20

Just as in 1918 we paid with our blood for the fact that in 1914=20
and 1915 we did not proceed to trample the head of the Marxist=20
serpent once and for all, we would have to pay most catastrophi=C2=AC=20
cally if in the spring of 1923 we did not avail ourselves of the op-=20


Failure to Settle Accounts with Marxism 679=20

portunity to halt the activity of the Marxist traitors and murder=C2=AC=20
ers of the nation for good.=20

Any idea of real resistance to France was utter nonsense if we=20
did not declare war against those forces which five years before=20
had broken German resistance on the battlefields from within.=20
Only bourgeois minds can arrive at the incredible opinion that=20
Marxism might now have changed, and that the scoundrelly lead=C2=AC=20
ers of 1918, who then coldly trampled two million dead underfoot,=20
the better to climb into the various seats of government, now in=20
1923 were suddenly ready to render their tribute to the national=20
conscience. An incredible and really insane idea, the hope that=20
the traitors of former days would suddenly turn into fighters for=20
a German freedom. It never entered their heads. No more than=20
a hyena abandons carrion does a Marxist abandon treason . And=20
don=E2=80=99t annoy me, if you please, with the stupidest of all arguments,=
=20
that, after all, so many workers bled for Germany. German=20
workers, yes, but then they were no longer international Marxists.=20
If in 1914 the German working class in their innermost convictions=20
had still consisted of Marxists, the War would have been over in=20
three weeks. Germany would have collapsed even before the first=20
soldier set foot across the border. No, the fact that the German=20
people was then still fighting proved that the Marxist delusion had=20
not yet been able to gnaw its way into the bottommost depths.=20
But in exact proportion as, in the course of the War, the German=20
worker and the German soldier fell back into the hands of the=20
Marxist leaders, in exactly that proportion he was lost to the=20
fatherland. If at the beginning of the War and during the War=20
twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the peo=C2=AC=20
ple had been held under poison gas, as happened to hundreds of=20
thousands of our very best German workers in the field, the=20
sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.=20
On the contrary: twelve thousand scoundrels eliminated in time=20
might have saved the lives of a million real Germans, valuable for=20
the future. But it just happened to be in the line of bourgeois=20
* statesmanship =E2=80=99 to subject millions to a bloody end on the battle=
=C2=AC=20
field without batting an eyelash, but to regard ten or twelve=20


/=20


680=20


Mein Kampe=20


thousand traitors, profiteers, usurers, and swindlers as a sacred=20
national treasure and openly proclaim their inviolability. We=20
never know which is greater in this bourgeois world, the im=C2=AC=20
becility, weakness, and cowardice, or their deep-dyed corruption.=20
It is truly a class doomed by Fate, but unfortunately, however, it=20
is dragging a whole nation with it into the abyss.=20

And in 1923 we faced exactly the same situation as in 1918.=20
Regardless what type of resistance was decided on, the first re=C2=AC=20
quirement was always the elimination of the Marxist poison from=20
our national body. And in my opinion, it was then the very first=20
task of a truly national government to seek and find the forces=20
which were resolved to declare a war of annihilation on Marxism,=20
and then to give these forces a free road; it was their duty not to=20
worship the idiocy of daw and order =E2=80=99 at a moment when the=20
enemy without was administering the most annihilating blow to=20
the fatherland and at home treason lurked on every street corner.=20
No, at that time a really national government should have de=C2=AC=20
sired disorder and unrest, provided only that amid the confusion=20
a basic reckoning with Marxism at last became possible and=20
actually took place. If this were not done, any thought of re=C2=AC=20
sistance, regardless of what type, was pure madness.=20

Such a reckoning of real world-historical import, it must be=20
admitted, does not follow the schedules of a privy councilor or=20
some dried-up old minister, but the eternal laws of life on this=20
earth, which are the struggle for this life and which remain strug=C2=AC=20
gle. It should have been borne in mind that the bloodiest civil=20
wars have often given rise to a steeled and healthy people, while=20
artificially cultivated states of peace have more than once pro=C2=AC=20
duced a rottenness that stank to high Heaven. You do not alter=20
the destinies of nations in kid gloves. And so, in the year 1923,=20
the most brutal thrust was required to seize the vipers that were=20
devouring our people. Only if this were successful did the prepa=C2=AC=20
ration of active resistance have meaning.=20

At that time I often talked my throat hoarse, attempting to=20
make it clear, at least to the so-called national circles, what was=20
now at stake, and that, if we made the same blunders as in 1914=20


Failure to Settle Accounts with Marxism 681=20

and the years that followed, the end would inevitably be the same=20
as in 1918. Again and again, I begged them to give free rein to=20
Fate, and to give our movement an opportunity for a reckoning=20
with Marxism; but I preached to deaf ears. They all knew better,=20
including the chief of the armed forces, until at length they faced=20
the most wretched capitulation of all time.=20

Then I realized in my innermost soul that the German bour=C2=AC=20
geoisie was at the end of its mission and is destined for no further=20
mission. Then I saw how all these parties continued to bicker=20
with the Marxists only out of competitors=E2=80=99 envy, without any=20
serious desire to annihilate them; at heart they had all of them=20
long since reconciled themselves to the destruction of the father-=20
land, and what moved them was only grave concern that they=20
themselves should be able to partake in the funeral feast. That=20
is all they were still =E2=80=98 fighting =E2=80=99 for.=20

In this period =E2=80=94 I openly admit =E2=80=94 I conceived the profounde=
st=20
admiration for the great man south of the Alps, who, full of ar=C2=AC=20
dent love for his people, made no pacts with the enemies of Italy,=20
but strove for their annihilation by all ways and means. What=20
will rank Mussolini among the great men of this earth is his de=C2=AC=20
termination not to share Italy with the Marxists, but to destroy=20
internationalism and save the fatherland from it.=20

How miserable and dwarfish our German would-be statesmen=20
seem by comparison, and how one gags with disgust when these=20
nonentities, with boorish arrogance, dare to criticize this man who=20
is a thousand times greater than they; and how painful it is to=20
think that this is happening in a land wnich barely half a century=20
ago could call a Bismarck its leader.=20

In view of this attitude on the part of the bourgeoisie and the=20
policy of leaving the Marxists untouched, the fate of any active=20
resistance in 1923 was decided in advance. To fight France with=20
the deadly enemy in our own ranks would have been sheer idiocy.=20
What was done after that could at most be shadow-boxing, staged=20
to satisfy the nationalistic element in Germany in some measure,=20
or in reality to dupe the =E2=80=98 seething soul of the people.=E2=80=99 I=
f they had=20
seriously believed in what they were doing, they would have had=20


682=20


Mein Kampf=20


to recognize that the strength of a nation lies primarily, not in=20
its weapons, but in its will, and that, before foreign enemies are=20
conquered, the enemy within must be annihilated; otherwise God=20
help us if victory does not reward our arms on the very first day.=20
Once so much as the shadow of a defeat grazes a people that is not=20
free of internal enemies, its force of resistance will break and the=20
foe will be the final victor.=20

This could be predicted as early as February, 1923. Let no one=20
mention the questionableness of a military success against France!=20
For if the result of the German action in the face of the invasion=20
of the Ruhr had only been the destruction of Marxism at home,=20
by that fact alone success would have been on our side. A Ger=C2=AC=20
many saved from these mortal enemies of her existence and her=20
future would possess forces which the whole world could no=20
longer have stifled. On the day when Marxism is smashed in Ger=C2=AC=20
many, her fetters will in truth be broken forever. For never in our=20
history have we been defeated by the strength of our foes, but=20
always by our own vices and by the enemies in our own camp.=20

Since the leaders of the German state could not summon up the=20
courage for such a heroic deed, logically they could only have=20
chosen the first course, that of doing nothing at all and letting=20
things slide.=20

But in the great hour Heaven sent the German people a great=20
man, Herr von Cuno. He was not really a statesman or a poli=C2=AC=20
tician by profession, and of course still less by birth; he was a=20
kind of political hack, who was needed only for the performance=20
of certain definite jobs; otherwise he was really more adept at=20
business. A curse for Germany, because this businessman in=20
politics regarded politics as an economic enterprise and acted ac=C2=AC=20
cordingly.=20

=E2=80=98France has occupied the Ruhr; what is in the Ruhr? Coal.=20
Therefore, France has occupied the Ruhr on account of the coal.=E2=80=99=20
What was more natural for Herr Cuno than the idea of striking in=20
order that the French should get no coal, whereupon, in the opin=C2=AC=20
ion of Herr Cuno, they would one day evacuate the Ruhr when the=20
enterprise proved unprofitable. Such, more or less, was this=20


Cuno=E2=80=99s Way=20


683=20


e eminent * =E2=80=98national=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98statesman/ who in Stuttgart=
 and elsewhere=20
was allowed to address his people, and whom the people gaped at=20
in blissful admiration.=20

But for a strike, of course, the Marxists were needed, for it was=20
primarily the workers who would have to strike. Therefore, it=20
was necessary to bring the worker (and in the brain of one of these=20
bourgeois statesman he is always synonymous with the Marxist)=20
into a united front with all the other Germans. The way these=20
moldy political party cheeses glowed at the sound of such a bril=C2=AC=20
liant slogan was something to behold! Not only a product of=20
genius, it was national at the same time =E2=80=94 there at last they had=
=20
what at heart they had been seeking the whole while. The bridge=20
to Marxism had been found, and the national swindler was en=C2=AC=20
abled to put on a Teutonic face and mouth German phrases while=20
holding out a friendly hand to the international traitor. And the=20
traitor seized it with the utmost alacrity. For just as Cuno=20
needed the Marxist leaders for his =E2=80=98 united front,=E2=80=99 the Mar=
xist=20
leaders were just as urgently in need of Cuno=E2=80=99s money. So it was=20
a help to both parties. Cuno obtained his united front, formed of=20
national windbags and anti-national scoundrels, and the inter=C2=AC=20
national swindlers received state funds to carry out the supreme=20
mission of their struggle =E2=80=94 that is, to destroy the national econ=
=C2=AC=20
omy, and this time actually at the expense of the state. An=20
immortal idea, to save the nation by buying a general strike; in=20
any case a slogan in which even the most indifferent good-for-=20
nothing could join with full enthusiasm.=20

It is generally known that a nation cannot he made free by prayers.=20
But maybe one could be made free by sitting with folded arms, and=20
that had to be historically tested. If at that time Herr Cuno, instead=20
of proclaiming his subsidized general strike and setting it up as the=20
foundation of the 1 united front,=E2=80=99 had only demanded two more hours=
=20
of work from every German, the =E2=80=98united front=E2=80=99 swindle would=
 have=20
shown itself up on the third day. Peoples are not freed by doing=20
nothing, but by sacrifices.=20

To be sure, this so-called passive resistance as such could not=20
be maintained for long. For only a man totally ignorant of war-=20


684=20


Mein Kampe=20


fare could imagine that occupying armies can be frightened away=20
by such ridiculous means. And that alone could have been the=20
sense of an action the costs of which ran into billions and which=20
materially helped to shatter the national currency to its very=20
foundations.=20

Of course, the French could make themselves at home in the=20
Ruhr with a certain sense of inner relief as soon as they saw the=20
resisters employing such methods. They had in fact obtained=20
from us the best directions for bringing a recalcitrant civilian=20
population to reason when its conduct represents a serious men=C2=AC=20
ace to the occupation authorities. With what lightning speed,=20
after all, we had routed the Belgian franc-tireur bands nine years=20
previous and made the seriousness of the situation clear to the=20
civilian population when the German armies ran the risk of in=C2=AC=20
curring serious damage from their activity. As soon as the passive=20
resistance in the Ruhr had grown really dangerous to the French,=20
it would have been child=E2=80=99s play for the troops of occupation to put=
=20
a cruel end to the whole childish mischief in less than a week. For=20
the ultimate question is always this: What do we do if the passive=20
resistance ends by really getting on an adversary=E2=80=99s nerves and he=
=20
takes up the struggle against it with brutal strong-arm methods?=20
Are we then resolved to offer further resistance? If so, we must=20
for better or worse invite the gravest, bloodiest persecutions.=20
But then we stand exactly where active resistance would put us=20
=E2=80=94 face to face with struggle. Hence any so-called passive re=C2=AC=
=20
sistance has an inner meaning only if it is backed by determina=C2=AC=20
tion to continue it if necessary in open struggle or in undercover=20
guerrilla warfare. In general, any such struggle will depend on a=20
conviction that success is possible. As soon as a besieged fortress=20
under heavy attack by the enemy is forced to abandon the last=20
hope of relief, for all practical purposes it gives up the fight, es=C2=AC=
=20
pecially when in such a case the defender is lured by the cer=C2=AC=20
tainty of life rather than probable death. Rob the garrison of a=20
surrounded fortress of faith in a possible liberation, and all the=20
forces of defense will abruptly collapse.=20

Therefore, a passive resistance in the Ruhr, in view of the ulti-=20


Position of the National Socialists=20


685=20


mate consequences it could and inevitably would produce in case=20
it were actually successful, only had meaning if an active front=20
were built up behind it. Then, it is true, there is no limit to what=20
could have been drawn from our people. If every one of these=20
Westphalians had known that the homeland was setting up an=20
army of eighty or a hundred divisions, the Frenchmen would have=20
found it thorny going. There are always more courageous men=20
willing to sacrifice themselves for success than for something=20
that is obviously futile.=20

It was a classical case which forced us National Socialists to=20
take the sharpest position against a so-called national slogan.=20
And so we did. In these months I was attacked no little by men=20
whose whole national attitude was nothing but a mixture of=20
stupidity and outward sham, all of whom joined in the shouting=20
only because they were unable to resist the agreeable thrill of sud=C2=AC=
=20
denly being able to put on national airs without any danger. I=20
regarded this most lamentable of all united fronts as a most=20
ridiculous phenomenon, and history has proved me right.=20

As soon as the unions had filled their treasuries with Cuno=E2=80=99s=20
funds, and the passive resistance was faced with the decision of=20
passing from defense with folded arms to active attack, the Red=20
hyenas immediately bolted from the national sheep herd and be=C2=AC=20
came again what they had always been. Quietly and ingloriously=20
Herr Cuno retreated to his ships, and Germany was richer by one=20
experience and poorer by one great hope.=20

Down to late midsummer many officers, and they were as=C2=AC=20
suredly not the worst, had at heart not believed in such a dis=C2=AC=20
graceful development. They had all hoped that, if not openly,=20
in secret at least, preparations had been undertaken to make this=20
insolent French assault a turning point in German history. Even=20
in our ranks there were many who put their confidence at least=20
in the Reichswehr. And this conviction was so alive that it de=C2=AC=20
cisively determined the actions and particularly the training of=20
innumerable young people.=20

But when the disgraceful collapse occurred and the crushing,=20
disgraceful capitulation followed, the sacrifice of billions of marks=20


686=20


Mein Kampf=20


and thousands of young Germans =E2=80=94 who had been stupid enough=20
to take the promises of the Reich=E2=80=99s leaders seriously =E2=80=94 ind=
igna=C2=AC=20
tion flared into a blaze against such a betrayal of our unfortunate=20
people. In millions of minds the conviction suddenly arose bright=20
and clear that only a radical elimination of the whole ruling sys=C2=AC=20
tem could save Germany.=20

Never was the time riper, never did it cry out more imperiously=20
for such a solution than in the moment when, on the one hand,=20
naked treason shamelessly revealed itself, while, on the other=20
hand, a people was economically delivered to slow starvation.=20
Since the state itself trampled all laws of loyalty and faith under=C2=AC=
=20
foot, mocked the rights of its citizens, cheated millions of its=20
truest sons of their sacrifices and robbed millions of others of their=20
last penny, it had no further right to expect anything but hatred=20
of its subjects. And in any event, this hatred against the spoilers=20
of people and fatherland was pressing toward an explosion. In=20
this place I can only point to the final sentence of my last speech=20
in the great trial of spring, 1924:=20

=E2=80=98The judges of this state may go right ahead and convict us for=20
our actions at that time, but History, acting as the goddess of a=20
higher truth and a higher justice, will one day smilingly tear up=20
this verdict, acquitting us of all guilt and blame.=E2=80=99=20

And then she will call all those before her judgment seat, who=20
today, in possession of power, trample justice and law underfoot,=20
who have led our people into misery and ruin and amid the mis=C2=AC=20
fortune of the fatherland have valued their own ego above the=20
life of the community.=20

In this place I shall not continue with an account of those=20
events which led to and brought about the 8th of November,=20
1923. I shall not do so because in so doing I see no promise for=20
the future, and because above all it is useless to reopen wounds=20
that seem scarcely healed; moreover, because it is useless to speak=20
of guilt regarding men who in the bottom of their hearts, perhaps,=20
were all devoted to their nation with equal love, and who only=20
missed or failed to understand the common road.=20

In view of the great common misfortune of our fatherland, I=20


Our Dead Admonish Us to Duty=20


687=20


today no longer wish to wound and thus perhaps alienate those=20
who one day in the future will have to form the great united=20
front of those who are really true Germans at heart against the=20
common front of the enemies of our people. For I know that some=20
day the time will come when even those who then faced us with=20
hostility, will think with veneration of those who traveled the=20
bitter road of death for their German people.=20

I wish at the end of the second volume to remind the supporters=20
and champions of our doctrine of those eighteen 1 heroes, to whom=20
I have dedicated the first volume of my work, those heroes who=20
sacrificed themselves for us all with the clearest consciousness.=20
They must forever recall the wavering and the weak to the ful=C2=AC=20
fillment of his duty, a duty which they themselves in the best=20
faith carried to its final consequence. And among them I want=20
also to count that man, one of the best, who devoted his life to=20
the awakening of his, our people, in his writings and his thoughts=20
and finally in his deeds:=20

Conclusion=20


n=20

V^/n November 9, 1923, in the fourth year=20
of its existence, the National Socialist German Workers=E2=80=99 Party=20
was dissolved and prohibited in the whole Reich territory. Today=20
in November, 1926, it stands again free before us, stronger and=20
inwardly firmer than ever before.=20

All the persecutions of the movement and its individual leaders,=20
all vilifications and slanders, were powerless to harm it. The cor=C2=AC=20
rectness of its ideas, the purity of its will, its supporters=E2=80=99 spir=
it of=20
self-sacrifice, have caused it to issue from all repressions stronger=20
than ever.=20

If, in the world of our present parliamentary corruption, it be=C2=AC=20
comes more and more aware of the profoundest essence of its=20
struggle, feels itself to be the purest embodiment of the value of=20
race and personality and conducts itself accordingly, it will with=20
almost mathematical certainty some day emerge victorious from=20
its struggle. Just as Germany must inevitably win her rightful=20
position on this earth if she is led and organized according to the=20
same principles.=20

A state which in this age of racial poisoning dedicates itself to=20
the care of its best racial elements must some day become lord of=20
the earth.=20

May the adherents of our movement never forget this if ever=20
the magnitude of the sacrifices should beguile them to an anxious=20
comparison with the possible results.=20
